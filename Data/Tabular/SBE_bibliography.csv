Herein, we investigated the effects of the lunar regolith simulant (LHS-1) at different concentrations in cow manure mixtures on the survival and fitness of Eisenia fetida. During 14 and 60-day experiments, although E. fetida showed an increased mortality with LHS-1 alone, most of the population survived. More numerous tunnels were observed when exposed to the higher concentrations of LHS-1 (poor in nutrients for earthworms). This may be related to an increased mobility for food search. The cocoons production was not affected by different substrate treatments, except for the highest concentration of LHS-1. No effects of different LHS-1 concentrations on the amount of ingested substrate were recorded.

Here, the application of an ink-based three-dimensional (3D) printing strategy to the structural design of a Lunar regolith simulant-based geopolymer (HIT-LRS-1 GP) was first reported, and high-precision carbon fiber/quartz sand-reinforced biomimetic patterns inspired by the cellular sandwich structure of plant stems were fabricated. This study demonstrated how different cellular sandwich structures can balance the structure–property relationship and how to achieve unprecedented damage tolerance for a geopolymer composite. The results presented that components based on these biomimetic architectures exhibited stable non-catastrophic fracture characteristics regardless of the compression direction, and each structure possessed effective damage tolerance and anisotropy of mechanical properties. The results showed that the compressive strengths of honeycomb sandwich patterns, triangular sandwich patterns, wave sandwich patterns, and rectangular sandwich patterns in the Y-axis (Z-axis) direction were 15.6, 17.9, 11.3, and 20.1 MPa (46.7, 26.5, 23.8, and 34.4 MPa), respectively, and the maximum fracture strain corresponding to the above four structures could reach 10.2%, 6.7%, 5.8%, and 5.9% (12.1%, 13.7%, 13.6%, and 13.9%), respectively.",bio-inspired patterns | damage tolerance | geopolymer (GP) | in situ resource utilization (ISRU) | Lunar regolith simulant (LRS) | three-dimensional (3D) printing,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NSFC,21SYSX0170,Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program,SBE,"['bio-inspired patterns ', ' damage tolerance ', ' geopolymer (GP) ', ' in situ resource utilization (ISRU) ', ' Lunar regolith simulant (LRS) ', ' three-dimensional (3D) printing']",bio-inspired patterns | damage tolerance | geopolymer (GP) | in situ resource utilization (ISRU) | Lunar regolith simulant (LRS) | three-dimensional (3D) printing,"Ma, Siqi;Jiang, Yuqi;Fu, Shuai;He, Peigang;Sun, Chengyue;Duan, Xiaoming;Jia, Dechang;Colombo, Paolo;Zhou, Yu"

Synthetic biology has generated many different molecular systems able to support the evolution of molecular information; these alternatives to standard DNA and RNA support biotechnology, including DNA synthesis, human diagnostics, biomedical research and medicine; in particular, they support laboratory in vitro evolution (LIVE) with performance to generate catalysts at least 10 4 -10 5 fold better than standard DNA libraries, enhancing access to receptors and catalysts on demand. Coupling nanostructures to the products of LIVE with expanded DNA offers new approaches for disease therapy; and nevertheless, a polyelectrolyte structure and size regular building blocks are required for any informational polymer to support Darwinian evolution.

Since the dominant cost of a space mission is the cost of launching mass, components of a system were converted to an equivalent mass, including power, heat rejection, and volume. Three-year roundtrip crewed missions were evaluated for the International Space Station, the Moon, and Mars. The average Equivalent System Mass (ESM) of MES-AA is 1.38x and 2.84x lower than prepackaged food and microalgae SCP, respectively. The expected electricity-to-calorie conversion efficiency of MES-AA is 19.8 %, consuming 3.45 kW to fully feed five astronauts; diets would realistically include multiple foods. MES-AA has a higher energy efficiency than any currently investigated resilient food in space.

Bacteria and archaea are able to survive in the deep ocean or subsurface of Earth, where pressures of up to 1 kbar are reached. The deep subsurface of Mars may host high concentrations of ions in brines, such as perchlorates, but we know little about how these conditions and the resulting osmotic stress conditions would affect the habitability of such environments for cellular life. We discuss the combined effects of osmotic (salts, organic cosolvents) and hydrostatic pressures on the structure, stability, and reactivity of biomolecular systems, including membranes, proteins, and nucleic acids. To this end, a variety of biophysical techniques have been applied, including calorimetry, UV/vis, FTIR and fluorescence spectroscopy, and neutron and X-ray scattering, in conjunction with high pressure techniques. Knowledge of these effects is essential to our understanding of life exposed to such harsh conditions, and of the physical limits of life in general.

A key challenge is the production of high-strength structural materials from in situ resources to provide spacious habitats with adequate radiation shielding. Ideally, the production of such materials will be achieved through relatively simple, low-energy processes that support other critical systems. Here, we demonstrate the use of ordinary starch as a binder for simulated extraterrestrial regolith to produce a high-strength biocomposite material, termed StarCrete. With this technique, surplus starch produced as food for inhabitants could be used for construction, integrating two critical systems and significantly simplifying the architecture needed to sustain early extraterrestrial colonies. After optimisation, lunar and Martian StarCrete achieved compressive strengths of 91.7 and 72.0 MPa, respectively, which is well within the domain of high-strength concrete (>42 MPa) and surpasses most other proposed technology solutions despite being a relatively low-energy process. The flexural strength of the lunar and Martian StarCrete, at 2.1 and 8.4 MPa, respectively, was also comparable to ordinary concrete (2.5-4.5 MPa).",biocomposite | biopolymer-bound soil composites | design of experiments | in situ resource utilisation | space | starch,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,UKRI,EP/S01778X/1,UK Research and Innovation,SBE,"['biocomposite ', ' biopolymer-bound soil composites ', ' design of experiments ', ' in situ resource utilisation ', ' space ', ' starch']",biocomposite | biopolymer-bound soil composites | design of experiments | in situ resource utilisation | space | starch,"Roberts, Aled D.;Scrutton, Nigel S."

Methods: We assessed the physicochemical properties of the substrates, and the physiological and biometric parameters of potato plants grown in pot on these substrates, in cold glasshouse. Results: Both R100 and S100 were alkaline (pH ≥ 8.6) and coarse-textured, lacking organic matter and pivotal macronutrients. The amendment with compost significantly lowered their alkaline pH and improved the chemical fertility. The sandy-loam textured VS was sub-alkaline, slightly calcareous, with higher organic C and nutrient availability than RS. This latter was neutral-to-sub-alkaline, clay textured, poorly calcareous, with significantly higher CEC than VS. Leaf CO2 assimilation rate was higher in plants grown in terrestrial soils and S100. Plant growth was greater in VS, R70C30 and S70C30, while it was reduced on R100. Plants produced healthy tubers on all the substrates.

The International Space Exploration Coordination Group has set a roadmap whose long-range strategy envisions the expansion of human presence in the solar system to progress with exploration and knowledge and to accelerate innovation. Crewed missions to Mars could be envisaged by 2040. In this scenario, finding ways to use the local resources for the provision of food, construction materials, propellants, pharmaceuticals is needed. Plants are important resources for deep space manned missions because they produce phytochemicals of pharmaceutical relevance, are sources of food and provide oxygen which is crucial in bioregenerative life support systems. Growth analysis and plant biomass yield have been previously evaluated on Martian regolith simulants; however, molecular approaches employing gene expression analysis and proteomics are still missing. The present work aims at filling this gap by providing molecular data on a representative member of the Poaceae, Lolium multiflorum Lam., grown on potting soil and a Martian regolith simulant (MMS-1). The molecular data were complemented with optical microscopy of root/leaf tissues and physico-chemical analyses. The results show that the plants grew for 2 weeks on regolith simulants. The leaves were bent downwards and chlorotic, the roots developed a lacunar aerenchyma and small brownish deposits containing Fe were observed. Gene expression analysis and proteomics revealed changes in transcripts related to the phenylpropanoid pathway, stress response, primary metabolism and proteins involved in translation and DNA methylation. Additionally, the growth of plants slightly but significantly modified the pH of the regolith simulants. The results here presented constitute a useful resource to get a comprehensive understanding of the major factors impacting the growth of plants on MMS-1.",In situ resource utilization | Lolium multiflorum | Martian regolith simulants | Microscopy | Proteomics | qPCR,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,,SBE,"['In situ resource utilization ', ' Lolium multiflorum ', ' Martian regolith simulants ', ' Microscopy ', ' Proteomics ', ' qPCR']",In situ resource utilization | Lolium multiflorum | Martian regolith simulants | Microscopy | Proteomics | qPCR,"Berni, Roberto;Leclercq, Céline C.;Roux, Philippe;Hausman, Jean Francois;Renaut, Jenny;Guerriero, Gea"

Further, ESM does not account well for the differential reliabilities of the underlying technologies. The uncertainty in the performance of technology should incur an equivalent mass penalty for technology options that might otherwise provide a mass advantage. Here we draw attention to the importance of addressing these limitations and formulate the basis of an extension of ESM that allows for a direct method for analyzing, optimizing, and comparing different mission systems.

The Earth-bound supply of material and food is restricted, and in situ resource utilisation (ISRU) is a prerequisite. Excellent candidates for delivering several services are unicellular algae, such as the space-approved flagellate Euglena gracilis. This review summarizes the main characteristics of this unicellular organism. Euglena has been exposed on various platforms that alter the impact of gravity to analyse its corresponding gravity-dependent physiological and molecular genetic responses. The sensory transduction chain of gravitaxis in E. gracilis has been identified. The molecular gravi-(mechano-)receptors are mechanosensory calcium channels (TRP channels). The inward gated calcium binds specifically to one of several calmodulins (CaM.2), which, in turn, activates an adenylyl cyclase. This enzyme uses ATP to produce cAMP, which induces protein kinase A, followed by the phosphorylation of a motor protein in the flagellum, initiating a course correction, and, finally, resulting in gravitaxis. During long space missions, a considerable amount of food, oxygen, and water has to be carried, and the exhaled carbon dioxide has to be removed. In this context, E. gracilis is an excellent candidate for biological life support systems, since it produces oxygen by photosynthesis, takes up carbon dioxide, and is even edible.

To respond to this challenge, we have proposed the use of fungal bio-composites for growing extra-terrestrial structures, directly at the destination, significantly lowering the mass of structural materials transported from Earth and minimizing the need for high mass robotic operations and infrastructure preparations. Throughout human history, the construction of habitats has used biologically produced materials, from bone and skins to wood and limestone. Traditionally, the materials are used only post-mortem. Currently, the idea of working with living biological organisms, and the phenomenon of growth itself, is of increasing interest in architecture and space applications. Here, we describe the use of mycelium-based composites as an alternative, biological approach for constructing regenerative and adaptive buildings in extrem environments and extraterrestrial habitats. It is a continuation of our research program initiated under the auspices of the “Myco-architecture Off Planet” NASA NIAC Team. These composites, which are fire-resistant, and insulating, do not consist of volatile organic compounds from petrochemical products and can be used independently or in conjunction with regolith, could employ the living biological growth in a controlled environment, for the process of material fabrication, assembly, maintenance, and repair, providing structures resilient to extra-terrestrial hazards. Here we outline the potential and challenges of using bio-composites for Earth and space applications.

Episodes like the formation of a Moon large enough and near enough to cause tides in the Earth’s waters and rocks, a core of sufficient iron with sufficient angular momentum to generate a protective magnetosphere around Earth, and assumption of a planetary axis angle that generates the ecological variation of our seasonal cycles. The living things that did arise on this planet have been modifying their habitats on Earth since they first appeared. Modifications that include the greening of Earth by photosynthetic organisms, which turned a predominantly reducing atmosphere into an oxidising one, the consequent precipitation of iron oxides into iron ore strata, and the formation of huge deposits of limestone by calcifying organisms. The episodes on which we wish to concentrate are 1) the frequent involvement of marine calcifiers (coccolithophores, foraminifera, molluscs, crustacea, corals, echinoderms), that have been described as ecosystem engineers modifying habitats in a generally positive way for other organisms, and 2) the frequent involvement of humans in changing the Earth’s biosphere in a generally negative way for other organisms. The fossil record shows that ancestral marine calcifiers had the physiology to cope with both acidified oceans and great excesses of atmospheric CO2 periodically throughout the past 500 million years, creating vast remains of shells as limestone strata in the process. So, our core belief is that humankind must look to the oceans for a solution to present-day climate change. The marine calcifiers of this planet have a track record of decisively modifying both oceans and atmospheres but take millions of years to do it. On the other hand, humanity works fast; in just a few thousand years we have driven scores of animals and plants to extinction, and in just a few hundred years we have so drastically modified our atmosphere that, arguably, we stand on the verge of extinction ourselves. Of all Earth’s ecosystems, those built around biological calcifiers, which all convert organic carbon into inorganic limestone, are the only ones that offer the prospect of permanent net removal of CO2 from our atmosphere. These are the carbon-removal biotechnologies we should be seeking to exploit.",atmosphere | bioengineering | blue-carbon | calcifiers | carbon | climate | nature-based,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,,SBE,"['atmosphere ', ' bioengineering ', ' blue-carbon ', ' calcifiers ', ' carbon ', ' climate ', ' nature-based']",atmosphere | bioengineering | blue-carbon | calcifiers | carbon | climate | nature-based,"Moore, David;Heilweck, Matthias;Petros, Peter"

In order to reduce the costs of onboard resources when growing plants in SG, the method of adaptive search optimization of the lighting parameters of plants during their growth was used. The minimum specific value of the light-dependent part of the equivalent system mass (ESM) per unit of grown biomass (G) was used as the current optimization criterion for SG. The current value of the criterion at plant age t during period of time Δt can be written as: min G (I, t, Δt) = min{[Cv (k3/k2) + CE (k4/k2)·I]/F(I,t) Δt}. Here F(I,t) - is the current net photosynthesis of the crop; CV,CE – cost factors of consumed by SG electric power unit and unit of volume occupied by the SG, in kg/m2 and kg/kW, respectively; k2-k4 - constants of dimension matching; I – lighting attributes which include combination of parameters (intensity, spectrum, time distribution). If lighting spectrum and time distribution are constant, I will equal to average PPFD. Obviously, the cost coefficients CV, СE can depend both on spacecraft design and on space mission specificity – flight duration, task program, crew number, etc. The CV and CE have been calculated for 3 published scenarios of space missions: for a manned station in low Earth orbit, a planetary mission on a Lunar base and a planetary mission on Mars.

Above the crop, an LED lamp was mounted with autonomous regulation of supply currents for LEDs with red (660 nm) and white (color temperature 4000 K) radiation. The crop net photosynthesis was automatically measured every 15 min by the rate of CO2 decrease in the closed phytotron air. The control software and hardware complex calculated the value of the optimality criterion G (t) at the time of measurement and calculated the optimal parameters of the supply currents for red and white LEDs, which were implemented at the next iteration of the search.

After short-term stays, a permanent presence will be desirable to enable a wealth of scientific discoveries. This will require providing crews with life-support consumables in amounts that are too large to be imported from Earth. Part of these consumables could be produced on site with bioprocesses, but the feedstock should not have to be imported. A solution under consideration lies in using diazotrophic, rock-weathering cyanobacteria as primary producers: fed with materials naturally available on site, they would provide the nutrients required by other organisms. This concept has recently gained momentum but progress is slowed by a lack of consistency across contributing teams, and notably of a shared model organism. With the hope to address this issue, we present the work performed to select our current model. We started with preselected strains from the Nostocaceae family. After sequencing the genome of Anabaena sp. PCC 7938-the only one not yet available- we compared the strains' genomic data to determine their relatedness and provide insights into their physiology. We then assessed and compared relevant features: chiefly, their abilities to utilize nutrients from Martian regolith, their resistance to perchlorates (toxic compounds present in the regolith), and their suitability as feedstock for secondary producers (here a heterotrophic bacterium and a higher plant). This led to the selection of Anabaena sp. PCC 7938, which we propose as a model cyanobacterium for the development of bioprocesses based on Mars's natural resources. IMPORTANCE The sustainability of crewed missions to Mars could be increased by biotechnologies which are connected to resources available on site via primary producers: diazotrophic, rock-leaching cyanobacteria. Indeed, this could greatly reduce the mass of payloads to be imported from Earth. The concept is gaining momentum but progress is hindered by a lack of consistency across research teams. We consequently describe the selection process that led to the choice of our model strain, demonstrate its relevance to the field, and propose it as a shared model organism.

At the same time, radiation is the greatest permanent health risk for humans venturing into deep space. To protect astronauts beyond Earth's magnetosphere, advanced shielding against ionizing as well as non-ionizing radiation is highly sought after. In search of innovative solutions to these challenges, biotechnology appeals with suitability for in situ resource utilization (ISRU), self-regeneration, and adaptability. Where other organisms fail, certain microscopic fungi thrive in high-radiation environments on Earth, showing high radioresistance. The adaptation of some of these molds to areas, such as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has coined the terms positive “radiotropism” and “radiotrophy”, reflecting the affinity to and stimulation by radiation, and sometimes even enhanced growth under ionizing conditions. These abilities may be mediated by the pigment melanin, many forms of which also have radioprotective properties. The expectation is that these capabilities are extendable to radiation in space. To study its growth in space, an experiment cultivating Cladosporium sphaerospermum Penzig ATCC® 11289™ aboard the International Space Station (ISS) was conducted while monitoring radiation beneath the formed biomass in comparison to a no-growth negative control. A qualitative growth advantage in space was observable. Quantitatively, a 1.21 ± 0.37-times higher growth rate than in the ground control was determined, which might indicate a radioadaptive response to space radiation.

The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to space bioremediation, recycling of waste and to reinforce regenerative life support systems. However, the science around space biomining is still young. Relevant differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions exist, including the rock types and ores available for mining, and a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be a possibility. It is, therefore, necessary to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications to learn the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expand our knowledge on organotrophic and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, as well as on anaerobic biomining, and investigate the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations posed by the space environments.",Bioremediation | BLSS | ISRU | Space bioleaching | Space biomining | Space microbiology | Space sustainability,4,1,repositoryvor,Green,NASA,ST/R000875/1,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,SBE,"['Bioremediation ', ' BLSS ', ' ISRU ', ' Space bioleaching ', ' Space biomining ', ' Space microbiology ', ' Space sustainability']",Bioremediation | BLSS | ISRU | Space bioleaching | Space biomining | Space microbiology | Space sustainability,"Santomartino, Rosa;Zea, Luis;Cockell, Charles S."

Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains as Sphingomonas sanguinis (n = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identified 23 Sphingomonas species. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected for S. sanguinis in the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS S. sanguinis isolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these Sphingomonas strains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of these strains with the well-characterized Sphingomonas sp. LK11, an arid desert strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-related S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future. IMPORTANCE Sphingomonas is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of the Sphingomonas genus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification of Sphingomonas members from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future in situ studies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS Sphingomonas isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.",International Space Station | Phytohormones | Plant growth promotion | Sphingomonas,3,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,,SBE,"['International Space Station ', ' Phytohormones ', ' Plant growth promotion ', ' Sphingomonas']",International Space Station | Phytohormones | Plant growth promotion | Sphingomonas,"Lombardino, Jonathan;Bijlani, Swati;Singh, Nitin K.;Wood, Jason M.;Barker, Richard;Gilroy, Simon;Wang, Clay C.C.;Venkateswaran, Kasthuri"

The combination of BLSS and ISRU may allow sustainable food production on Moon and Mars. This task poses several challenges, including the effects of partial gravity, the limited availability of oxygen and water, and the self-sustaining management of resources. Lunar and Martian regoliths are not available on Earth; therefore, space research studies are conducted on regolith simulants that replicate the physicochemical properties of extra-terrestrial regoliths (as assessed in situ by previous missions). This review provides an overview of the physicochemical properties and mineralogical composition of commercially available Lunar and Martian regolith simulants. Subsequently, it describes potential strategies and sustainable practices for creating regolith simulants akin to terrestrial soil, which is a highly dynamic environment where microbiota and humified organic matter interact with the mineral moiety. These strategies include the amendment of simulants with composted organic wastes, which can turn nutrient-poor and alkaline crushed rocks into efficient life-sustaining substrates equipped with enhanced physical, hydraulic, and chemical properties. In this regard, we provide a comprehensive analysis of recent scientific works focusing on the exploitation of regolith simulant-based substrates as plant growth media.

A Genius-of-Place is a process developed by Biomimicry 3.8 that results in a summary of research on the organisms from a specific place to inform design work that is highly adapted to, either the same place, or a place with similar meteorological, geophysical, and biological characteristics. The Biomimicry Thinking methodology with a Biology to Design path was used. The objective in using this approach is to find nature-inspired solutions (locally attuned) for materials, strategies, and structures for extreme environments that may be helpful in designing for aerospace applications. Development of a Genius-of-Place study allows us to look into nature in specific places or areas so that we are able to obtain information on locally attuned organisms. These organisms are expected to have developed unique strategies. By conducting studies of this type, we are posing three questions: (1) How are organisms thriving in this environment? (2) What strategies have they developed to leverage the material and energy flows? and (3) How do these strategies work and can they be mimicked in the human design world? The Atacama Desert was chosen as the studied biome due to its unique conditions on the planet. Atacama, the driest nonpolar desert on Earth, is situated between the Andes and the Chilean Coast Range and is composed of sand, salt lakes, and stony terrain. Species that live in this environment have adapted to thrive under extreme conditions. The Genius-of-Place approach allowed us to learn about and draw inspiration from several species that have an extraordinary ability to adapt to an extreme environment: llareta (Azorella compacta), desert holly (Atriplex atacamensis), tamarugo (Prosopis tamarugo), desert saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), vicuña (Vicugna vicugna), and guanaco (Lama guanicoe). From the studied species, the design principles of their strategies were conceptualized, and design concepts were developed with the final objective to propose locally attuned sustainable designs based on well-established strategies that are well adapted to the place.

There is a high interest in the biodiversity of this type of extreme environments for several reasons. Studies indicate that extreme acid environments may reflect early Earth conditions, and are thus, suitable for astrobiological experiments as acidophilic microorganisms survive on the sulfates and iron oxides in AMD-contaminated waters/sediments, an analogous environment to Mars, other reasons are related to the biotechnological potential of extremophiles.

Plants will be fundamental components of future human missions to Mars, and the question of whether Mars soils can support plant growth is still open. Moreover, plant cultivation may suffer from the lack of in situ liquid water, which might constitute one of the biggest challenges for ISRU-based food production on Mars. Enhancing the crop yield with less water input and improving water utilization by plants are thus chief concern for sustainable ISRU food production. Hydrogels are polymers able to absorb large quantity of water and to increase soil water retention, plant establishment and growth. This work reports on the short-term assessment of plant growth in Mars soil analogs supplemented with hydrogels. Soil analogs consisted of sand and clay-rich material, with low organic matter content and alkaline pH. Soils were supplemented with 10% (w/w) potting medium and were sampled in Utah desert, in the vicinity of the Mars Desert Research Station, surrounded by soils sharing similarities in mineralogical and chemical composition to Martian soils. Height and dry biomass of spearmint (Mentha spicata) were compared under various irrigation frequencies, and seed germination of radish (Raphanus sativus) were monitored. Under limited irrigation, results indicate that the soil analogs were less capable of supporting plant growth as a comparison to potting medium. The effects of hydrogel supplementation were significant under limited irrigation and led to spearmint heights increased by 3 and 6% in clay- and sand-containing soils, respectively. Similarly, hydrogel supplementation resulted in spearmint mass increased by 110% in clay-containing soils and 78% in sand-containing soils. Additionally, while radish seeds failed to germinate in soil analogs, hydrogel supplementation allows for the germination of 27% of seeds, indicating that hydrogels might help loosening dense media with low water retention. Collectively, the results suggest that supplementation with hydrogel and plant growth substrate could help plants cope with limited irrigation and poor alkaline Mars soil analogs, and are discussed in the context of strategies for ISRU-based off-world colonization.",astrobiology | colonization | hydrogel | in situ resource utilization (ISRU) | life support systems | Mars | plant,0,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,Université Catholique de Louvain,SBE,"['astrobiology ', ' colonization ', ' hydrogel ', ' in situ resource utilization (ISRU) ', ' life support systems ', ' Mars ', ' plant']",astrobiology | colonization | hydrogel | in situ resource utilization (ISRU) | life support systems | Mars | plant,"Peyrusson, Frédéric"

The moon jellyfish Aurelia coerulea is one of the most common jellyfish worldwide and is particularly abundant in sheltered coastal lagoons and marinas of the Mediterranean Sea, where it first appeared—as an alien species—in the last century, when Pacific oyster cultivation began. In the present study, the antioxidant and lysozyme antibacterial activities associated with extracts from different medusa compartments—namely the umbrella, oral arms, and secreted mucus—were investigated. Extracts from the oral arms of A. coerulea displayed significant antioxidant activity. Similarly, lysozyme-like activity was the highest in extracts from oral arms. These findings suggest that A. coerulea outbreaks may be used in the search for novel cytolytic and cytotoxic products against marine bacteria. The geographically wide occurrence and the seasonally high abundance of A. coerulea populations in coastal waters envisage and stimulate the search for biotechnological applications of jellyfish biomasses in the pharmaceutical, nutritional, and nutraceutical sectors.",Antimicrobial compounds | Bioactive compounds | Lysozyme-like activity | Moon medusa | Peptides,4,1,repositoryvor,Green,EC,undefined,European Commission,SBE,"['Antimicrobial compounds ', ' Bioactive compounds ', ' Lysozyme-like activity ', ' Moon medusa ', ' Peptides']",Antimicrobial compounds | Bioactive compounds | Lysozyme-like activity | Moon medusa | Peptides,"Stabili, Loredana;Rizzo, Lucia;Caprioli, Rosa;Leone, Antonella;Piraino, Stefano"

This research compares customary and alternative space foods to non-biological synthesis (NBS) systems using recycled CO2. Using electrochemical conversion of CO2 as a starting point, different carbohydrate synthesis routes are reviewed. Sugars and glycerol are considered as final products. Three roundtrip missions with 5 crew members and 3-year duration were analyzed: International Space Station, the Moon, and Mars. The equivalent system mass (ESM) technique was used to compare NBS systems to customarily storing prepackaged food, artificial-light grown Spirulina platensis, hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOB), and microbial electrosynthesis (MES). This allows for a launch cost comparison of systems with different characteristics, including equipment mass, onboard volume, and power and heat rejection requirements. Power consumption was estimated via mass and energy balances using literature values. The Mars mission ESM of the NBS system is estimated within 10−30 tonnes. This was compared to an average of 65 t for Spirulina, 35 t for prepackaged food, 25 t for MES, and 11 t for HOB. NBS is estimated to be among the most energy efficient options, together with HOB and MES. Electricity-to-food conversion efficiencies of 10–21 % and single-pass carbon yields up to ∼70 % are expected for an NBS system. Although NBS is not recommended over all alternatives (i.e. HOB), it is recommended over the prepackaged food and Spirulina benchmarks.

Over the last three decades, the Pharmaceutical Production Research Facility (PPRF) of the University of Calgary, founded by the late Professor Leo A. Behie, has carried out groundbreaking research focusing on the fundamentals of bioprocessing for various stem cells including human neural precursor cells (NPCs) and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). These efforts led to the development of serum-free growth media and expansion protocols for large-scale production of therapeutically-relevant NPCs for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Similarly, high-performance, defined growth media and reliable, large-scale computer-controlled bioreactor protocols were developed for the expansion of MSCs derived from human bone marrow and other sources and the generation of a therapeutically-relevant secretome. Important bioprocessing considerations such as the hydrodynamics of the bioreactor, mass transfer, cellular microenvironment and synergistic impact of media components were evaluated in these studies. Undoubtedly, the diverse topics of research carried out at PPRF significantly contributed to the translation of the laboratory-based stem cell culture studies into production of clinical-grade materials and eventually commercialization of stem cell-based therapies through applying principles of bioengineering and bioprocessing.",bioprocessing | bioreactor | cell therapy | growth media | stem cells,3,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['bioprocessing ', ' bioreactor ', ' cell therapy ', ' growth media ', ' stem cells']",bioprocessing | bioreactor | cell therapy | growth media | stem cells,"Panchalingam, Krishna;Wang, Tony;Jung, Sunghoon;Ahmadian Baghbaderani, Behnam"

Advanced technologies are being developed to support the adaptation to extraterrestrial environments and, with a view on the longer term, to support the viability of an independent economy. Biological processes will likely play a key role and lead to the production of life-support consumables, and other commodities, in a way that is cheaper and more sustainable than exclusively abiotic processes. Microbial communities could be used to sustain the crews’ health as well as for the production of consumables, for waste recycling, and for biomining. They can self-renew with little resources from Earth, be highly productive on a per-volume basis, and be highly versatile—all of which will be critical in planetary outposts. Well-defined, semi-open, and stress-resistant microecosystems are particularly promising. An instance of it is kombucha, known worldwide as a microbial association that produces an eponymous, widespread soft drink that could be valuable for sustaining crews’ health or as a synbiotic (i.e., probiotic and prebiotic) after a rational assemblage of defined probiotic bacteria and yeasts with endemic or engineered cellulose producers. Bacterial cellulose products offer a wide spectrum of possible functions, from leather-like to innovative smart materials during long-term missions and future activities in extraterrestrial settlements. Cellulose production by kombucha is zero-waste and could be linked to bioregenerative life support system (BLSS) loops. Another advantage of kombucha lies in its ability to mobilize inorganic ions from rocks, which may help feed BLSS from local resources.

We compare six technologies (three biotic capture methods and three abiotic capture methods), optimize scheduling to minimize ESM for each technology, and perform scenario analysis to consider a range of input stream compositions and pharmaceutical demand.

This phrase is well-suited to humanity's first crewed mission to Mars, which will likely be the most difficult and technologically challenging human endeavor ever undertaken. The high cost and significant time delay associated with delivering payloads to the Martian surface means that exploitation of resources in situ — including inorganic rock and dust (regolith), water deposits, and atmospheric gases — will be an important part of any crewed mission to the Red Planet. Yet there is one significant, but chronically overlooked, source of natural resources that will — by definition — also be available on any crewed mission to Mars: the crew themselves. In this work, we explore the use of human serum albumin (HSA) — a common protein obtained from blood plasma — as a binder for simulated Lunar and Martian regolith to produce so-called ‘extraterrestrial regolith biocomposites (ERBs).’ In essence, HSA produced by astronauts in vivo could be extracted on a semi-continuous basis and combined with Lunar or Martian regolith to ‘get stone from blood’, to rephrase the proverb. Employing a simple fabrication strategy, HSA-based ERBs were produced and displayed compressive strengths as high as 25.0 MPa. For comparison, standard concrete typically has a compressive strength ranging between 20 and 32 MPa. The incorporation of urea — which could be extracted from the urine, sweat, or tears of astronauts — could further increase the compressive strength by over 300% in some instances, with the best-performing formulation having an average compressive strength of 39.7 MPa. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HSA-ERBs have the potential to be 3D-printed, opening up an interesting potential avenue for extraterrestrial construction using human-derived feedstocks. The mechanism of adhesion was investigated and attributed to the dehydration-induced reorganization of the protein secondary structure into a densely hydrogen-bonded, supramolecular β-sheet network — analogous to the cohesion mechanism of spider silk. For comparison, synthetic spider silk and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were also investigated as regolith binders — which could also feasibly be produced on a Martian colony with future advancements in biomanufacturing technology.",3D-printing | Biopolymer-bound soil composites | Human serum albumin | Hybrid materials | In situ resource utilization | Recombinant spider silk,7,1,repositoryvor,Green,UKRI,EP/S01778X/1,UK Research and Innovation,SBE,"['3D-printing ', ' Biopolymer-bound soil composites ', ' Human serum albumin ', ' Hybrid materials ', ' In situ resource utilization ', ' Recombinant spider silk']",3D-printing | Biopolymer-bound soil composites | Human serum albumin | Hybrid materials | In situ resource utilization | Recombinant spider silk,"Roberts, A.

The analyzed ECLSS includes an In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) reactor for oxygen resupply and a Regenerative Fuel Cell System (RFCS) as power supply during shadow phases. The co-dependencies and interactions between the ECLSS sub-systems themselves and with the environment are incorporated to achieve a holistic system analysis. We used a fixed ECLSS configuration based on the current NASA plans for a Moon base ECLSS with a fixed function-to-subsystem allocation. The performed trade-offs are then restricted within the design space, to e.g. resize tanks and individual subsystems instead of considering other possible subsystems. We chose this approach because the aim of this paper is to perform an in-depth system analysis of all related subsystems and their interaction with the environment instead of a top-level trade-off. The first step is the selection of a suitable landing site and the dynamic simulation of its lighting conditions over the investigated period of 1 year. We use a slope map with a resolution of 120 m per pixel, a Permanently Shaded Region (PSR) map with a resolution of 240 m per pixel and a digital elevation model with a resolution of 240 m per point, which is interpolated from a source with a resolution of 60 m per pixel and meshed with triangles by the Thermal Moon Simulator (TherMoS) tool in order to calculate illumination values. The requirements chosen for the candidate landing sites are a slope of less than 5° over a diameter of at least 1 km and having both a PSR and a Peak of Light (POL) in less than 10 km distance. We discuss the four most promising candidate sites in this paper and calculate initial energy storage system estimates to select two landing sites for further analysis. We derive a reaction kinetics model for the ilmenite hydrogen reduction ISRU process from literature data and incorporate it into a dynamic model with simulated lighting and thermal conditions to calculate heat losses to the environment and the required electrical energy for its operation. In addition, we use the derived model to analyze and compare different design options of the ISRU reactor with an Equivalent System Mass (ESM) based optimization approach to identify the optimal operating conditions. Using this approach, we found operating temperatures above 1150 K resulted in higher ESM values for the reactor than lower temperatures. For the Moon base, we combine an ISS ECLSS model and the ISRU reactor model. The state-of-the-art urine and water processing technologies achieve recovery rates of up to 98%. Hence, we expect the overall ECLSS including the ISRU reactor to have a water surplus when combined with a Sabatier reactor to process metabolic CO2 from the crew into methane and water. Therefore, the Sabatier reactor combined with an electrolyzer can potentially generate methane and oxygen as fuel for resupply missions. The system can achieve a theoretic fuel production of 4100 kg per year using this approach. Although the dynamic analysis showed that only 2588 kg could be produced per year because of the lean operating conditions of the Sabatier and its efficiency of below 100%. The produced oxygen and methane could reduce operating costs for the base by reducing the required fuel resupply. Based on the power demands of the other subsystems and the available solar power and shadow duration at the selected landing site, we dimensioned the RFCS and estimate the required mass for it to 19,500 kg. Which is less than half the mass required if lithium batteries are used. The overall system requires resupply of approximately 6580 kg per year for a crew of six. The dynamic analysis of the system showed that the initial mostly steady state sizing approach can be optimized and relevant system parameters can be reduced by more than 15%.",ECLSS | Human spaceflight | Ilmenite reduction | ISRU | Landing site selection | Life support | LSS | Lunar south pole | Moon base | Thermal moon simulator | TherMoS | V-HAB | Virtual habitat,7,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['ECLSS ', ' Human spaceflight ', ' Ilmenite reduction ', ' ISRU ', ' Landing site selection ', ' Life support ', ' LSS ', ' Lunar south pole ', ' Moon base ', ' Thermal moon simulator ', ' TherMoS ', ' V-HAB ', ' Virtual habitat']",ECLSS | Human spaceflight | Ilmenite reduction | ISRU | Landing site selection | Life support | LSS | Lunar south pole | Moon base | Thermal moon simulator | TherMoS | V-HAB | Virtual habitat,"Kaschubek, Daniel;Killian, Matthias;Grill, Laura"

Optimization of artificial lighting parameters, such as the daily light integral and the ratios of different spectral components, can significantly reduce the cost of crop production in light culture including Space Greenhouses (SG) in Biological Life Support Systems (BLSS). However, the optimization of LED lighting systems is so far limited by the lack of information about the physiological effects caused by narrow-band radiation, as well as the complexity of the mathematical description of plant crops reactions to the changes of LED lighting parameters. In conditions of artificial illumination, crop producers usually strive to establish an optimal light regime that is constant throughout the whole growing season. However, there is experimental data on changes in the requirements for the illumination regime of crops with increasing age of plants. A promising approach to improving the parameters of crops LED lighting is the adaptive method of search engine optimization using biological feedback. The Adaptive Lighting System (ALS) is described on the basis of illuminator with red and white LEDs built at the Institute for Biomedical Problems (Moscow, Russia) for Chinese cabbage cultivation. The adaptive control procedure implements a continuous automatic search for current lighting parameters that provide optimal plant growth characteristics in real time. ALS includes a closed growth chamber with Light Assembly (LA) based on red and white LEDs, equipped with a Gas CO2 Analyzer (GA). The Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD) from each type of LEDs can be controlled independently from each other according to the program in the MicroProcessor (MP). Periodically, infrared GA measures the decrease in CO2 concentration inside the growth chamber caused by Visible Photosynthesis (VF) of the crop. MP receives a signal from the GA output and calculates the photosynthesis rate of the crop, as well as the value of the lighting quality functional at the current time. Then the program compares the obtained values of the optimization criterion at the current moment and at the previous step and calculates the direction of the gradient according to picked algorithm and the new values of the LED supply currents, leading to a change in the value of the optimization criterion in the right direction. Further, the power supply unit realizes the currents of LED chains of each type and LA changes the plant lighting mode. As a criterion for the lighting quality in SG we used the minimum specific value of the Equivalent System Mass (ESM), which depends on the plants lighting regime. The cost coefficients of the unit of SG planting area equivalent mass and the unit of electric power consumed by SG significantly depend both on the spacecraft design and on the space expedition scenario. According to the literature, the equivalent system mass estimates depending on the light flux density and the crop light efficiency have been calculated in a spacecraft for the space expedition scenario at a long-term use lunar base with a crew of 4. To search for the current optimal lighting parameters during the plant growth, gradient and simplex algorithms were used. As optimization factors, the integral PPFD incident on the crop at the shoot tips level and the ratio of red and white light flux densities (factors X1 and X2, respectively) were used. Factor X1 was regulated in the range from 200 μmol/(m2·s) to 700 μmol/(m2·s), and factor X2 was from 0 to 1.5. The effectiveness of ALS was evaluated by comparing ESM when using ALS or the best constant LED lighting from comparison experiment. Adaptive optimization of Chinese cabbage crop lighting from the 14th to 24th day of vegetation according to the minimum ESM criterion (1) for the lunar base expedition led to a 14.9% saving in the SG equivalent mass. Similar systems with other optimization criterion can be use for terrestrial plant factories.",Adaptive optimization | Crop productivity | Light spectral composition | Light-emitting diodes | Space greenhouse | Visible photosynthesis,0,0,,,РАН,undefined,Russian Academy of Sciences,SBE,"['Adaptive optimization ', ' Crop productivity ', ' Light spectral composition ', ' Light-emitting diodes ', ' Space greenhouse ', ' Visible photosynthesis']",Adaptive optimization | Crop productivity | Light spectral composition | Light-emitting diodes | Space greenhouse | Visible photosynthesis,"Berkovich, Y.;Buryak, A.;Ochkov, O.;Perevedentsev, O.;Smolyanina, S."

We observe that the Moon possesses in-situ resources but that these resources are of limited value in closed ecological life support systems (CELSS)—indeed, CELSS technology is most mature in recycling water and oxygen, the two resources that are abundant on the Moon. This places a premium on developing CELSS that recycle other elements that are rarified on the Moon including C and N in particular but also other elements such as P, S and K which might be challenging to extract from local resources.

For this purpose, crop growth area compositions from literature are compared with compositions derived from an optimization algorithm. The optimization algorithm uses literature data for crop growth rates and crop nutrient content to minimize the required crop growth area required to supply all nutrients for a human. The algorithm derives the required crop growth area per crew member under different dietary boundary conditions and the resulting nutrient supply is compared to reported diets from crops for spaceflight. The primary goal of this optimization is to find the minimal area required to supply all relevant macronutrients. The minimal area for the exact desired composition of macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats and proteins) was 106.86 m² using chard, lettuce, peanut, bell pepper, snap beans and spinach. If a deviation in the macronutrient composition is allowed the required area can be reduced to 39.88 m² of wheat and white potatoes. Since the variety of crops is a relevant factor for long term food supply, a limit of the maximum growth area per crop was introduced to derive a diet with more variety, which resulted in a minimal area of 57.04 m² using drybean, rice, snap beans, sweet potato, wheat and white potato. Based on this result, a further manual adjustment of the crop growth areas was performed to also introduce lettuce and tomato in the crops provided and adjust the remaining crop compositions to receive better macro- and micronutrient conformity while maintaining a crop growth area of 57 m². One major result of this analysis is that soybeans are not the most favorable crop with regard to protein and fat productivity and the focus of NASA crop selection for full nutrient supply on soybean results in exceedingly large required crop areas of 164.15 m². The resulting crop growth areas from both the optimization and literature are then analyzed as plant growth chambers (PGC) in the Life Support Trade-Off Tool (LiSTOT) of the institute of astronautic from the Technical University of Munich (TUM). LiSTOT calculates the impact of the PGC on an ISS based environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) using averaged steady state values for the plants from literature. Based on this result LiSTOT scales the physical chemical systems and calculates the resulting equivalent system mass (ESM) of the different cases. This approach allows the consideration of not only the PGC ESM, but also the impacts the PGC has on other ECLSS systems and their ESM. The ESM values for PGC were updated to assume LEDs instead of high pressure sodium lamps resulting in a new logistic mass of the PGC of 1.28 kg/(y m²) and a lower specific system mass of 87.7 kg/m². The mass balance analysis of carbon within the overall ECLSS lead to a reduction of the plant growth area to 50.6 m² and the break-even time with the ISS ECLSS was calculated to 87.2 years. With more optimistic assumptions for the LED and using urine as nutrient supply this time can be reduced to 14.6 years. The analysis also showed that the derived crop composition is not only favorable regarding nutrient supply but also with regard to the ESM and break-even time compared to previously reported crop compositions. Only the PGC with only wheat and white potatoes has a lower ESM but also provides a less balanced nutrient supply. This PGC is downscaled to 37.55 m² to achieve carbon balance and a break-even time of 38.4 years or 10.3 years with the optimistic assumptions.",Biological life support | BLSS | Dietary menu | Equivalent system mass | Nutritional balance | Optimization,2,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Biological life support ', ' BLSS ', ' Dietary menu ', ' Equivalent system mass ', ' Nutritional balance ', ' Optimization']",Biological life support | BLSS | Dietary menu | Equivalent system mass | Nutritional balance | Optimization,"Kaschubek, Daniel"

Such extracts were screened for antioxidant capacity, cytotoxicity, and physicochemical characterization in terms of polysaccharides, pigments, and total phenolic compounds. Pre-treatment with PBS proved the most effective toward overall pigment extraction and dissolution of the said mucilaginous sheath. Chroococcidiopsis sp. extracts have unfolded some interesting bioactive features, particularly upon pre-treatment with PBS—i.e., high antioxidant capacity and high content in polysaccharides, scytonemin, phycobiliproteins, and phenolic compounds.

However, as missions become more distant and extensive, obtaining these materials from in situ resource utilization is paramount. The combination of microorganisms with electrochemical technologies offers a platform for the production of critical chemicals and materials from CO2 and H2O, two compounds accessible on a target destination like Mars. One such potential commodity is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), a common biopolyester targeted for additive manufacturing of durable goods. Here, we present an integrated two-module process for the production of PHB from CO2. An autotrophic Sporomusa ovata (S. ovata) process converts CO2 to acetate which is then directly used as the primary carbon source for aerobic PHB production by Cupriavidus basilensis (C. basilensis). The S. ovata uses H2 as a reducing equivalent to be generated through electrocatalytic solar-driven H2O reduction. Conserving and recycling media components is critical, therefore we have designed and optimized our process to require no purification or filtering of the cell culture media between microbial production steps which could result in up to 98% weight savings. By inspecting cell population dynamics during culturing we determined that C. basilensis suitably proliferates in the presence of inactive S. ovata. During the bioprocess 10.4 mmol acetate L –1 day–1 were generated from CO2 by S. ovata in the optimized media. Subsequently, 12.54 mg PHB L–1 hour–1 were produced by C. basilensis in the unprocessed media with an overall carbon yield of 11.06% from acetate. In order to illustrate a pathway to increase overall productivity and enable scaling of our bench-top process, we developed a model indicating key process parameters to optimize.",acetogen biocatalyst | biomanufacturing | biopolymer | CO  reduction 2 | in situ resource utilization,4,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSF,DGE 1752814,National Science Foundation,SBE,"['acetogen biocatalyst ', ' biomanufacturing ', ' biopolymer ', ' CO  reduction 2 ', ' in situ resource utilization']",acetogen biocatalyst | biomanufacturing | biopolymer | CO  reduction 2 | in situ resource utilization,"Cestellos-Blanco, Stefano;Friedline, Skyler;Sander, Kyle B.;Abel, Anthony J.;Kim, Ji Min;Clark, Douglas S.;Arkin, Adam P.;Yang, Peidong"

Considering only fully bio-based solutions, two approaches can be distinguished, which comes down to the form of carbon that is being utilized: (a) the deployment of specialised species that can directly convert inorganic carbon (atmospheric CO2) into a target compound or (b) a two-step process that relies on independent fixation of carbon and the subsequent conversion of biomass and/or complex substrates into a target compound.

Sporosarcina pasteurii was used as a bacterial strain to initiate MICP process via ureolytic pathway. An admixture of a naturally occurring biopolymer (guar gum) and a structural reinforcement material (glass fibre) was used to enhance the mechanical properties of the bio-consolidated bricks. When supplemented with guar gum, the compressive strength of the resulting bricks was found to be significantly higher – by nearly six-fold – making them comparable to commercially used mud bricks. The addition of glass fibre reduced this strength a little, but had the benefit of making the space bricks machinable on a conventional lathe. This latter fact enabled the fabrication of precise and free-form shapes post-consolidation, without the need for specialized casting molds or dies. Details of the MICP process were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses.

After almost three decades of studies, mostly focused on molecular evolution and metagenomics, there is an increasing awareness of the multidisciplinary potential of these types of settings, especially for astrobiology. Since modern automatized exploration on extraterrestrial surfaces is essentially based on the morphological recognition of biosignatures, a macroscopic characterization of such sedimentary extreme environments and how they look is crucial to identify life properties, but it is a perspective that most molecular approaches frequently miss. Although acid mine drainage (AMD) systems are toxic and contaminated, they offer at the same time the bioengineering tools for natural remediation strategies. This work presents a biosedimentological characterization of the clastic iron stromatolites in the Tintillo river. They occur as laminated terraced iron formations that are the most distinctive sedimentary facies at the Tintillo river, which is polluted by AMD. Iron stromatolites originate from fluvial abiotic factors that interact with biological zonation. The authigenic precipitation of schwertmannite and jarosite results from microbial-mineral interactions between mineral and organic matrices. The Tintillo iron stromatolites are composed of bacterial filaments and diatoms as Nitzschia aurariae, Pinnularia aljustrelica, Stauroneis kriegeri, and Fragilaria sp. Furthermore, the active biosorption and bioleaching of sulfur are suggested by the black and white coloration of microbial filaments inside stromatolites. AMD systems are hazardous due to physical, chemical, and biological agents, but they also provide biogeochemical sources with which to infer past geochemical conditions on Earth and inform exploration efforts on extraterrestrial surfaces in the future.","Acidophiles | Biosignatures | Extreme environments.

This study compares prepackaged food, artificial light microalgae, and HOB. The dominant factor for each alternative is its relative mass due to high fuel cost needed to launch a payload into space. Thus, alternatives were evaluated using an equivalent system mass (ESM) technique developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Three distinct missions with a crew of 5 for a duration of 3 years were analyzed; including the International Space Station (ISS), the Moon, and Mars. The components of ESM considered were apparent mass, heat rejection, power, and pressurized volume. The selected power source for all systems was nuclear power. Electricity to biomass efficiencies were calculated for space to be 18% and 4.0% for HOB and microalgae, respectively. This study indicates that growing HOB is the least expensive alternative. The ESM of the HOB is on average a factor of 2.8 and 5.5 less than prepackaged food and microalgae, respectively. This alternative food study also relates to feeding Earth during a global agricultural catastrophe. Benefits of HOB include recycling wastes including CO2 and producing O2.

Long duration missions come with obstacles, especially when trying to create a sustainable environment in a location where “living off the land” is impossible. Some resources on the Moon can be recovered or resupplied; however, many resources such as those needed for sustaining life must be recycled or grown to support humans. To achieve sustainability, food and water must be grown and recycled using elements found within the habitat. NASA's current work focuses on food resupply and growing plants as supplemental nutrient content. This paper examines the possibility for using aquaculture systems to purify water while growing nutrient-rich species as food sources, which aquatic food sources would be ideal for a habitat environment, and which species might provide an ideal test case for future studies aboard ISS. The aquatic species should be rapidly grown with high protein content and low launch mass requirements.

Innovative research in orthopedics and bioengineering has helped formulate successful techniques, instrumentation, and surgical implants to re-establish the normal anatomy of the hip. Careful preoperative planning should be the first step for reconstruction. Infection must be ruled out initially, and if there is any doubt, a hip aspiration should be performed. Imaging starts with standard radiographs of the pelvis and the affected hip; specialized radiographs (such as Judet oblique views) and more advanced imaging such as MARS CT can help better assess the extent of the bone loss. The Paprosky classification is the most commonly used system to describe and categorize the location and magnitude of bone loss. The surgical approach chosen for reconstruction should provide a wide view of the acetabulum and therefore be as extensile as necessary. Current options for reconstruction include impaction grafting and cementless implants for minor defects. For major defects, new implants such as trabecular metal augments, cup-cage constructs, or custom-made devices are available.

Future human settlements and activities on Mars will rely on the effective ISRU and food production which directly extrapolates to making use of the available regolith for plant production. Untreated soil many contain several toxins (perchlorates), making it unfit for plant growth. This is where fungi (mycelia) comes into the picture. The main aim of this research is to initiate vegetation by treating Martian regolith by specific form of analysed mycelia and cleaning radiation particles through microfiltration. Fungi have been proven to decompose organic compounds (carbon rich components) of ecosystem by biological degradation. Various fungi species have been recorded to have grown in extreme conditions which are similar to conditions present in Space and in other planets. Radiotrophic fungi use radiation as an energy source to stimulate growth and have been found in extreme environments such as in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and on the exteriors of Low Earth orbit spacecraft. It is hence proved that fungal species with the presence of pigment Melanin can help clean radiation or tend to eat up the radiation to facilitate its growth. In addition to initiating plant growth, fungi are the most diverse species and one of the earliest eukaryotes to form, which makes them a potable candidate to use in biofuel production, waste mitigation, micro-food production, etc., Fungal network can initially help to ignite the organic production through myco-filtration by specific mycelial network. For the mycelial network to clean the regolith obtained by ISRU from the Martian surface/subsurface, the fungi can be trained initially to eat up the perchlorate present in the regolith, which initially serve as a food for it to expand. The extended process involves analysis of soil structure for efficient plant growth through on-board testing by astronauts or automation. The treated regolith could serve as the source of food cultivation and future utilization.

One aspect of consideration is the fate of the considerable waste that the crew will produce. Astronaut waste is a complex multi-component mixture that includes textiles (clothing, towels, and wipes), food and food packaging, metabolic wastes (feces and urine), as well as various wastes associated with sustaining a crew in space (toothpaste, rubber gloves, duct tape, tissues, paper, etc.). It is projected that a crew of four astronauts will generate 2,122 kg of waste per year. Over a 850 day mission to and from Mars, that will amount to 4,942 kg of waste. The current model used on the International Space Station is to stow the waste on a logistics module for eventual burn up during reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere. However, using the stowage model for a Mars mission would significantly increase the fuel requirements for vehicle maneuvering, and the Martian atmosphere is not dense enough to allow a full burn-up on reentry. Another option involves the ejection of solid trash into space; not only is the ejection model unseemly (i.e., littering in space) and a potential violation of current standards of planetary protection, but if airlocks are utilized, it comes at the cost of lost commodity in concurrently ejected cabin atmosphere (with current airlocks). In a previous study, the authors evaluated several waste processing technologies with regard to their effects on the equivalent system mass of the spacecraft. Equivalent system mass takes into account system related quantities such as volume, power consumption, and crew time, and reduces them to an equivalent mass that can be conveniently used for direct comparison. It was found that most trash to gas technologies have the potential to reduce the mass of a Mars transit vehicle by thousands of kg throughout the duration of a Mars mission. The primary savings of such mass reduction would come in the form of reduced propellant requirements; if the transit vehicle has less mass at Mars orbit insertion (for instance), then less propellant would be required to maneuver at that point in the mission. This is a compounding problem in that the propellant required for Earth orbit insertion, would have to be carried through the previous phases of the mission, thus requiring additional propellant to accelerate the greater mass of propellant required later in the mission. However, what was not previously known was exactly how much propellant savings would result, and how significant those savings would be. This work evaluates the propellant logistics associated with each of the previously reported trash to gas technologies. Specific technologies evaluated include: a NASA incinerator/gasifier, a NASA plasma gasification system, the Advanced Organic Waste Gasifier (produced under SBIR by Pioneer Astronautics, Inc.), NASA’s Orbital Syngas Commodity Augmentation Reactor (OSCAR), the Microwave Assisted Pyrolysis system (produced under SBIR by Advanced Fuel Research Corporation), a NASA plasma pyrolysis system, and the Torrefaction Processing Unit (produced under SBIR by Advanced Fuel Research Corporation). For each of these systems, a mission propellant requirements profile was developed, ultimately determining the launch mass for the transit vehicle. These launch masses were then used to compare the benefits of each system.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Olson, Joel A.;Chai, Patrick R.;Rinderknecht, David;Meier, Annie"

The correlation coefficients between the indicators are: r = 0.91, r = 0.64 and r = 0.69 (in bird‘s-foot-trefoil) and r = 0.74, r = 0.96 and r = 0.73 (in red fescue). The imported biological products increased dry matter digestibility for both forage crops. The regression dependence is statistically proven both for the percentage share of leaves (R2 = 0.354) and the mineral content (R2 = 0.777) for bird‘s-foot-trefoil, and the height of the grassland (R2 = 0.897), crude protein (R2 = 0.820), crude fats (R2 = 0.696) and hemicellulose (R2 = 0.955) in the dry forage matter of red fescue. Analyzed data in-dicates a positive correlation between the percentage share of Festuca rubra L. in the grassland and the values of phosphorus (r = 0.98), mineral substances (r = 0.79) and cellulose (r = 0.59).

Plants fulfill essential roles in those systems such as carbon dioxide removal, oxygen production, and food production. The systems required to grow plants in space, so-called space greenhouses, are complex and need to be built as efficient as possible. Thereby, the resources mass, volume, energy, and crewtime required to grow a certain amount of food are essential because these parameters define the effectiveness of the space greenhouse. However, the required resources depend on the size of the greenhouse which in turn depends on the productivity of the crops which in turn depend on the cultivation conditions. The output of such a system can be calculated using the Modified Energy Cascade plant production model, which can simulate the food output depending on the cultivation conditions. Traditionally, life support systems are evaluated using the Equivalent System Mass method, which can determine the cost effective life support architecture for a given mission scenario. By combining both, the influence of the cultivation conditions inside the space greenhouse on the effectiveness of the complete system can be investigated. It seems counterintuitive first, but it is more effective to increase the energy per area provided to the plants in the form of light. Although that increases the electrical energy demand per area, the reduction in required cultivation area and, therefore, system size leads to a more efficient system.",Bio-regenerative life support | ESM | Food production in space | MEC | Modeling | Simulation,3,1,repositoryam,Green,ESA,undefined,European Space Agency,SBE,"['Bio-regenerative life support ', ' ESM ', ' Food production in space ', ' MEC ', ' Modeling ', ' Simulation']",Bio-regenerative life support | ESM | Food production in space | MEC | Modeling | Simulation,"Zabel, Paul"

Landing on these bodies is challenging due to the reduced-gravity and airless environment. The correct planning of execution of the trajectory to land on the surface of the body is of cumbersome importance to prevent the vehicle from bouncing up and eventually reach escape velocity. In this paper, a bio-inspired trajectory planning method to land on the surface of a Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) with zero relative velocity is proposed. The method is based on Tau theory, which has been demonstrated to explain the way that humans and some other animals’ approach to different target spots to perform tasks such as perching, landing, and grasping. We have selected the NEA Apophis asteroid as our case study due to its accessibility, and small rotational velocity and orbit condition code. Two landing scenarios are studied; one considers the case where the satellite is hovering at a low altitude; the other corresponds to a landing maneuver right after a deorbiting or breaking phase, which may cause residual initial velocity in the vehicle prior to the landing maneuver. Once the descending trajectory is obtained, a closed-loop controller is in charge of achieving trajectory tracking and calculating the continuous and on/off thrust control signals. The simulation results show that the introduced approach can achieve zero final relative velocity in both cases for different initial condition, which is a requirement for a soft landing. Besides, different kinematic behaviors can be obtained by modifying the single variable named the Tau constant. The particular advantages of the method with respect to a commonly used approach are devised and analyzed as well.",Asteroid Landing | Bio-inspired | Guidance,5,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Asteroid Landing ', ' Bio-inspired ', ' Guidance']",Asteroid Landing | Bio-inspired | Guidance,"Valenzuela Najera, R.;Everett, L.;Ortega, A.

HABIT consists of two modules: (i) EnvPack (Environmental Package) that monitors the thermal environment (air and ground), the incident ultraviolet radiation, the near-surface winds and the atmospheric dust cycle; and (ii) BOTTLE (Brine Observation Transition To Liquid Experiment), an In-situ Resource Utilization instrument to produce liquid water for future Mars exploration. BOTTLE will be used also to investigate the electrical conductivity properties of the martian atmosphere, the present-day atmospheric-ground water cycle and to evaluate if liquid water can exist on Mars in the form of brines, and for how long. These variables measured by HABIT are critical to determine the present and future habitability of the martian surface. In this paper, we describe in detail the HABIT instrument and sensors, together with the calibration of its Flight Model (FM) and the Engineering Qualification Model (EQM) versions. The EnvPack module has heritage from previous missions operating on the surface of Mars, and the environmental observations of its sensors will be directly comparable to those delivered by those missions. HABIT can provide information of the local temperature with ±0.2 ​°C accuracy, local winds with ±0.3 ​m/s, surface brightness temperature with ±0.8 ​°C, incident UV irradiance with 10% error of its absolute value in the UV-A, UV-B, UV-C ranges, as well as in the total UV-ABC range, and two additional wavebands, dedicated to ozone absorption. The UV observations can be used to derive the total opacity column and thus monitor the dust and ozone cycles. BOTTLE can demonstrate the hydration state of a set of four deliquescent salts, which have been found on Mars (calcium chloride, ferric sulphate, magnesium perchlorate and sodium perchlorate) by monitoring their electric conductivity (EC). The EC of the air and the dry salts under Earth ambient, clean room conditions is of the order of 0.1 μScm−1. We have simulated HABIT operations, within an environmental chamber, under martian conditions similar to those expected at Oxia Planum. For dry, CO2 atmospheric conditions at martian pressures, the air EC can be as low as 10−8 μScm−1, however it increases with the relative humidity (RH) percentage. The laboratory experiments show that after an increase from 0 to 60% RH within a few hours, the EC of the air increased up to 10−1 μScm−1, magnesium perchlorate hydrated and reached values of 10 μScm-1, whereas calcium chloride deliquesced forming a liquid state with EC of 102 μScm−1. HABIT will operate with a regular cadence, through day and night. The Electronic Unit (EU) is protected with a heater that is activated when its temperature is below −33 ​°C and disabled if the temperature of the surface platform rises above −30 ​°C. Additionally, the heaters of the BOTTLE unit can be activated to dehydrate the salts and reset the experiment. HABIT weighs only 918 ​g. Its power consumption depends on the operation mode and internal temperature, and it varies between 0.7 ​W, for nominal operation, and 13.1 ​W (when heaters are turned on at full intensity). HABIT has a baseline data rate of 1.5 MB/sol. In addition to providing critical environmental observations, this light and robust instrument, will be the first demonstrator of a water capturing system on the surface of Mars, and the first European In-Situ Resource Utilization in the surface of another planet.",Astrobiology | Atmosphere | Brines | ExoMars | Habitability | Instrumentation | ISRU | Mars | Regolith | Surface platform | Water,10,0,repositoryvor,Green,IRF,MDM-2017-0737,Interthyr Research Foundation,SBE,"['Astrobiology ', ' Atmosphere ', ' Brines ', ' ExoMars ', ' Habitability ', ' Instrumentation ', ' ISRU ', ' Mars ', ' Regolith ', ' Surface platform ', ' Water']",Astrobiology | Atmosphere | Brines | ExoMars | Habitability | Instrumentation | ISRU | Mars | Regolith | Surface platform | Water,"Martín-Torres, Javier;Zorzano, María Paz;Soria-Salinas, Álvaro;Nazarious, Miracle Israel;Konatham, Samuel;Mathanlal, Thasshwin;Ramachandran, Abhilash Vakkada;Ramírez-Luque, Juan Antonio;Mantas-Nakhai, Roberto"

HABIT is composed by two modules: Environmental Package (EnvPack) and Brine Observation Transition To Liquid Experiment (BOTTLE). EnvPack will help to study the current habitability conditions on Mars investigating the air and surface thermal ranges and Ultraviolet (UV) irradiance; and BOTTLE is a container with four independent vessels housing deliquescent salts, which are known to be present on Mars, where the liquid water will be produced after deliquescence. In order to prevent capillarity of deliquescent or hydrated salts, a mixture of deliquescent salts with Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) based on polyacrylamide is utilized. This mixture has deliquescent and hydrogel properties and can be reused by applying a thermal cycle, complying thus with the purpose of the instrument. A High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) grade filter made of polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) porous membrane sandwiched between spunbounded non-woven fabric stands as a physical barrier allowing interaction between the gaseous molecules of the Martian atmosphere and the salt mixtures, and at the same time preventing the passage of any potential biological contamination from the cells to the outside or vice-versa. In addition to the physical barrier, a strict bioburden reduction and analysis procedure is applied to the hardware and the contained salt mixtures adhering to the European Cooperation for Space Standardization protocol of microbial examination of flight hardware (ECSS-Q-ST-70-55C). The deliquescent salts and the SAP products need to be properly treated independently to adhere to the planetary protection protocols. In this manuscript, we describe the bioburden reduction process utilized to sterilize the salt mixtures in BOTTLE and the assays adopted to validate the sterilization. We also describe the construction of a low-cost, portable ISO 7 cleanroom tent, exclusively designed for planetary protection tests. The sterilization process involves Dry Heat Microbial Reduction (DHMR) of the deliquescent salts and the SAP mixtures. The performance of SAP after DHMR is validated to ensure its working efficiency after sterilization. A slightly modified version of the standard swab assay is used in the validation process and a comparison is made between samples exposed to a thermal shock treatment and those without thermal shock, to determine the best assay to be applied for future space hardware utilizing such salt mixtures for planetary investigation and In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). The demonstration of the compatibility of these products with the processes commonly required for space applications has implications for the future exploration of Mars.",Bioburden assay | Bioburden control | Dry heat microbial reduction | Planetary protection,3,1,repositoryam,Green,ESA,MDM-2017-0737,European Space Agency,SBE,"['Bioburden assay ', ' Bioburden control ', ' Dry heat microbial reduction ', ' Planetary protection']",Bioburden assay | Bioburden control | Dry heat microbial reduction | Planetary protection,"Mathanlal, Thasshwin;Nazarious, Miracle Israel;Ramachandran, Abhilash Vakkada;Zorzano, Maria Paz;Martin-Torres, Javier;Rettberg, Petra"

However, their biological effects under the impact of various stressors have to be elucidated for safety reasons. In the spaceflight experiment, model biofilm kombucha microbial community (KMC) samples, in which Komagataeibacter intermedius was a dominant community-member, were exposed under simulated Martian factors (i.e., pressure, atmosphere, and UV-illumination) outside the International Space Station (ISS) for 1.5 years. In this study, we have determined that OMVs from post-flight K. intermedius displayed changes in membrane composition, depending on the location of the samples and some other factors. Membrane lipids such as sterols, fatty acids (FAs), and phospholipids (PLs) were modulated under the Mars-like stressors, and saturated FAs, as well as both short-chain saturated and trans FAs, appeared in the membranes of OMVs shed by both post-UV-illuminated and “dark” bacteria. The relative content of zwitterionic and anionic PLs changed, producing a change in surface properties of outer membranes, thereby resulting in a loss of interaction capability with polynucleotides. The changed composition of membranes promoted a bigger OMV size, which correlated with changes of OMV fitness. Biochemical characterization of the membrane-associated enzymes revealed an increase in their activity (DNAse, dehydrogenase) compared to wild type. Other functional membrane-associated capabilities of OMVs (e.g., proton accumulation, interaction with linear DNA, or synaptosomes) were also altered after exposure to the spaceflight stressors. Despite alterations in membranes, vesicles did not acquire endotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. Altogether, our results show that OMVs, originating from rationally selected nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, can be considered as candidates in the design of postbiotics or edible mucosal vaccines for in situ production in extreme environment. Furthermore, these OMVs could also be used as promising delivery vectors for applications in Astromedicine.",biosafety | functionality | lipids | Mars-like stressors | outer membrane vesicles,9,1,repositoryam,Green,NASU,47/2018,National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine,SBE,"['biosafety ', ' functionality ', ' lipids ', ' Mars-like stressors ', ' outer membrane vesicles']",biosafety | functionality | lipids | Mars-like stressors | outer membrane vesicles,"Podolich, Olga;Kukharenko, Olga;Zaets, Iryna;Orlovska, Iryna;Palchykovska, Larysa;Zaika, Leonid;Sysoliatin, Serhii;Zubova, Ganna;Reva, Oleg;Galkin, Maxym;Horid’ko, Tetyana;Kosiakova, Halyna;Borisova, Tatiana;Kravchenko, Volodymyr;Skoryk, Mykola;Kremenskoy, Maxym;Ghosh, Preetam;Barh, Debmalya;Góes-Neto, Aristóteles;Azevedo, Vasco;de Vera, Jean Pierre;Kozyrovska, Natalia"

The adsorption potential of the hydrochars investigated was compared with that of a commercial powdered activated carbon (PAC). It was found that the CAMBI and FS hydrochars were effective only after chemical activation. KOH activation increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal from 33.0 to 59.6% and 75.2% for FS and CAMBI, respectively. Extra activation with HCl improved the adsorption efficiency of FS, increasing COD removal to 79.3%, but not for the CAMBI hydrochar even though its surface area was increased. Acidic pH aided organics removal for both hydrochars. PAC adsorption capacity was the highest (> 90%), and this was not affected by pH.

One class of solidified regolith, Biopolymer-bound Soil Composites (BSC), consists of regolith mixed with a small amount of biopolymer binding agent (10% w/w). This paper characterizes BSC's micrometeoroid impact performance using experimental and numerical methods. Micrometeoroids are a notable hazard of the Lunar environment and pose a challenging design consideration. A total of 17 hypervelocity impact experiments were conducted on BSC targets at NASA's White Sands Testing Facility. Numerical simulations of the hypervelocity impact experiments were carried out using CTH, a shock physics code developed by Sandia National Laboratories. Comparisons between the experimental craters and the simulation results indicate that there is good agreement between crater dimensions of the hypervelocity impact experiments and the CTH model. The CTH model developed in this paper provides (1) a damage prediction tool that allows for the necessary extrapolation of micrometeoroid impact velocities beyond what is experimentally achievable and into the velocity regime that is relevant for micrometeoroids and (2) a material design tool that is capable of varying material parameters computationally, ultimately allowing for the engineering and optimization of BSC's performance under impact loading.",Biopolymer-bound soil composites | Damage prediction | Hypervelocity impact | Micrometeoroid impact | Numerical modeling,8,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Biopolymer-bound soil composites ', ' Damage prediction ', ' Hypervelocity impact ', ' Micrometeoroid impact ', ' Numerical modeling']",Biopolymer-bound soil composites | Damage prediction | Hypervelocity impact | Micrometeoroid impact | Numerical modeling,"Allende, Maria I.;Miller, Joshua E.;Davis, B.

Analytical power-law relationships were derived to predict transient crater dimensions, such as volume and diameter, from projectile features, such as diameter, density, and velocity. The scaling exponents determined for BSC transient crater volume and diameter are comparable to those of quartzite, sandstone, and basalt and indicate that crater formation in BSC is largely driven by the kinetic energy of the projectile, as expected for cohesive low-porosity materials.",,6,0,,,NASA,undefined,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,SBE,,,"Allende, Maria I.;Davis, B.

The wild type green alga Chlorella vulgaris strain SAG 211-12 was selected as model microorganism due to its photoautotrophic growth, high biomass yield, cultivation flexibility and long-term cultivation robustness. The current study presents for the first time a stable xenic long-term processing of microalgae in a novel microgravity capable membrane raceway photobioreactor for 188 days with the focus on algal growth kinetics and gas evolution. In particular, culture homogeneity and viability were monitored and evaluated during the whole cultivation process due to their putative crucial impact on long-term functionality and efficiency of a closed cultivation system. Based on a specially designed cyclic batch cultivation process for SAG 211-12, a successive biomass growth up to a maximum of 12.2 g l−1 with a max. global volumetric productivity of 1.3 g l−1 d−1 was reached within the closed loop system. The photosynthetic capacity was assessed to a global molar photosynthetic quotient of 0.31. Furthermore, cultivation parameters for a change from batch to continuous processing at high biomass densities and proliferation rates are introduced. The presented µgPBR miniature plant and the developed high throughput cultivation process are planned to be tested under real space conditions within the PBR@LSR project (microgravity and cosmic radiation) aboard the International Space Station with an operation period of up to 180 days to investigate the impact on long-term system stability.",Chlorella vulgaris | Hybrid life support system | ISS space flight experiment | Membrane photobioreactor | Microalgae | Xenic cultivation,21,0,,,ESA,undefined,European Space Agency,SBE,"['Chlorella vulgaris ', ' Hybrid life support system ', ' ISS space flight experiment ', ' Membrane photobioreactor ', ' Microalgae ', ' Xenic cultivation']",Chlorella vulgaris | Hybrid life support system | ISS space flight experiment | Membrane photobioreactor | Microalgae | Xenic cultivation,"Helisch, Harald;Keppler, Jochen;Detrell, Gisela;Belz, Stefan;Ewald, Reinhold;Fasoulas, Stefanos;Heyer, Arnd G."

This paper focuses on uncertainty quantification of a model of a space crop cultivation system, which is one of several systems that are required on a long-duration manned Mars mission. The model performs constrained optimization of the equivalent system mass (ESM) metric, which augments shipped mass costs with those of pressurized volume, demanded power, thermal control, and needed crew time. This paper uses surrogate modeling for fast quantification of the effect of probabilistic uncertainty in mission-critical parameters of semi-empirical equations that describe crop growth and equipment operation. This work shows sparse polynomial chaos-Kriging (PCK) yields a computationally cheap-to-evaluate surrogate for the minimum ESM that accounts for probabilistic uncertainty in 86 model parameters. This surrogate model accelerates a global sensitivity analysis that elucidates which crop growth and equipment operation parameters are critical to mission outcome variability.

Additionally, students and alumni have begun developing the AMARIS lunar rover, demonstrating the importance of engaging students in space- based scientific research within the academic pipeline while utilizing commercial off-the-shelf and CubeSat technology. According to Apollo 17 astronaut Gene Cernan, “Dust is probably one of our greatest inhibitors to a nominal operation on the moon.” Bombardment of micrometeoroids form glassy fragments called agglutinates, which cause hardware failures and are toxic to astronauts. There is still no effective method of protecting against this abrasive and adhesive dust. Energetic charged particles charge the surface regolith by ejecting secondary electrons from atoms, thus forming positively charged regions. Forces of attraction between these dust particles are mainly horizontal, while the repulsive forces are mainly vertical, creating a dust cloud from the rise of particles. The team proposes that ionizing particles have the ability to also charge surfaces comprised of atoms with low ionization energy. The AMARIS mission will evaluate the potential to repel dust using an ultra thin lithium nanofoil coating positively charged through ionization for use on instruments and suits. AMARIS' landing site will be Lacus Mortis. The regolith depth is expected to be one to two inches, and slopes on the surface will be less than 12 with rocks a maximum height of 0.35m. AMARIS will be 1U until deployed from Astrobotic's Peregrine Lander onto the lunar surface using a Nitinol hinge, forming a 2U footprint. Its batteries will be fully charged by Peregrine-provided power, and necessary system diagnostic checks will be performed by BLUECUBE to verify internal power sources and wireless communication. Once deployed, AMARIS will transition to surface mode, and Peregrine-provided power and wired communication will be discontinued. The rover will traverse through remote operation approximately 100m from the landing site and transmit experimental data through the lander and back to Earth using a USB port. Total mission life will be eight Earth days.

Addressing these elements in current designs is fully realistic, being based on known analysis methods associated with Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) and its related Equivalent System Mass (ESM) analysis/justifications used for human space mission traded studies. These methods have been consistently used to give Technical Readiness Level (TRL) assessments over the last 50 years to justify public funding, but here are initially used (and modified) for assessing project direction in the current rapidly developing commercial marketplace.

Although the ultimate source of all life is unknown, many investigators believe Earth, Mars, and Venus may have been seeded with life when these planets, and the sun, were forming in a galactic cluster of thousands of stars and protoplanets. Yet others hypothesize that while and after becoming established members of this solar system, these worlds became contaminated with life during the heavy bombardment phase when struck by millions of life-bearing meteors, asteroids, comets and oceans of ice. Because bolide impacts may eject tons of life-bearing debris into space, and as powerful solar winds may blow upper atmospheric organisms into space, these three planets may have repeatedly exchanged living organisms for billions of years. In support of these hypotheses is evidence suggestive of stromatolites, algae, and lichens on Mars, fungi on Mars and Venus, and formations resembling fossilized acritarchs and metazoans on Mars, and fossilized impressions resembling microbial organisms on the lunar surface, and dormant microbes recovered from the interior of a lunar camera.

Despite efforts to keep spacecraft clean during these ground testing operations, as well as during transportation, recontamination frequently occurs and results in the need to re-clean the spacecraft, putting stress on the spacecraft assembly critical path. In response, the Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group (BPPG) at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has designed a Ground Support Biobarrier (GSB) capable of protecting flight hardware continuously from an up-to 150 °C Heat Microbial Reduction (HMR) sterilization through hardware integration with the spacecraft, itself. The biobarrier consists of aluminum brackets bolted together and covered with thin aluminum sheets sealed via epoxy. The base plate of the biobarrier contains bolt connections and a gasket to ensure that all venting is through the HEPA-filtered vent when the biobarrier is closed. Additionally, the GSB allows for vapor hydrogen peroxide (VHP) sterilization as well as the ability to functionally test hardware without opening the barrier. The GSB provides a safety-net against microbiological re-contamination during critical functional testing, decreasing the need for re-cleaning and reducing schedule impact risk.",Biobarrier | Biological cleanliness | Contamination control | Planetary protection | Recontamination prevention,0,0,,,NASA,undefined,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,SBE,"['Biobarrier ', ' Biological cleanliness ', ' Contamination control ', ' Planetary protection ', ' Recontamination prevention']",Biobarrier | Biological cleanliness | Contamination control | Planetary protection | Recontamination prevention,"Patel, Nikunj;Dean, Zachary;Salinas, Yuki;Shiraishi, Lori;Newlin, Laura"

To obtain these materials in remote locations, such as Mars, biological production is of interest. The aromatic polymer precursor para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) can be derived from the shikimate pathway through metabolic engineering of Bacillus subtilis, an organism suited for space synthetic biology. Our engineering strategy included repair of the defective indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (trpC), knockout of one chorismate mutase isozyme (aroH) and overexpression of the aminodeoxychorismate synthase (pabAB) and aminodeoxychorismate lyase (pabC) from the bacteria Corynebacterium callunae and Xenorhabdus bovienii respectively. Further, a fusion-protein enzyme (pabABC) was created for channelling of the carbon flux. Using adaptive evolution, mutants of the production strain, able to metabolize xylose, were created, to explore and compare pABA production capacity from different carbon sources. Rather than the efficiency of the substrate or performance of the biochemical pathway, the product toxicity, which was strongly dependent on the pH, appeared to be the overall limiting factor. The highest titre achieved in shake flasks was 3.22 g l−1 with a carbon yield of 12.4% [C-mol/C-mol] from an amino sugar.

Over the years, researchers have employed various approaches to solve this ill-posed problem including regularization, optimization, and statistical estimation. It is still a topic of interest especially for researchers and clinicians whose goal is to adopt this technique in clinical applications. Among the wide range of mathematical tools available in the fields of operational research, inverse problems, optimization, and parameter estimation, spline-based techniques have been applied to inverse problems in several areas. If proper spline bases are chosen, the complexity of the problem can be significantly reduced while increasing estimation accuracy. However, there are few studies within the context of the inverse ECG problem that take advantage of this property of the spline-based approaches. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)-based method for the solution of the inverse ECG problem using two different collections of simulated data. The results show that the MARS-based method improves the inverse ECG solutions and is “robust” to modeling errors, especially in terms of localizing the arrhythmia sources.

It'll be essential to become self-sustaining through a combination of in situ resource utilization, waste recycling, and space farming. The latter can provide astronauts and colonists with locally grown food and biogenic oxygen, and will be an indispensable component of any future outpost in deep space. The type of agriculture that will develop itself in outer space will be extremely technologically mediated because of limited resources and the hostile conditions in which crops have to be cultivated. From a biopolitics perspective, this will cause a significant shift in power relations. Because of the extreme dependence on technology, the lack of open reservoirs (e.g., no atmosphere), and an atomized commodification of life-supporting resources (every molecule is valuable), space colonists will live in a world in which they are potentially vulnerable to inequalities, power concentrations, and even coercion. Historically, colonization and agriculture have always worked with each other. But in the unparalleled conditions of space, this dialectic relationship is bound to take on new contours, with its own unique set of ideologies and ethical ramifications. The 'Space Farming Project' is an art project that specifically addresses these issues. It was initiated by the international SEAD collective, developed in collaboration with Gluon and Howest, and supported by the Flemish Government. Together with a diverse community of volunteering technologists, agricultural researchers, teachers, and students, different space biology prototypes have been developed: a centrifuge for plant cultivation in space, a microgravity simulator, and experiments with spirulina algae and edible callus tissue. These are the central components of a larger art installation that also features visual and discursive references to the history and future of colonization, and its entwinement with agriculture.

This paper analyses and discusses a possible architecture, from the orbit selection to the life support system and transport infrastructure of the cis-lunar space station Gateway. Initially, the existing knowledge and previously presented concept from NASA will be disregarded on purpose. The final part of the analysis is the identification of differences between the newly developed architecture and the currently proposed architecture from NASA. Based on the differences advantages as well as disadvantages of both concepts are then discussed. The first part of the architecture is the life support system, which is analysed with a combination of multi-criteria analysis and Equivalent System Mass to select an optimal life support system. Additionally, the required initial launch mass of the systems as well as the required continuous resupply mass is calculated based on the selected life support system. The next step is the selection of a suitable orbit, which is performed by using the System Tool Kit to develop a database for the overall delta v demand of the mission for different orbits. The optimization considers the calculated mass requirements from the initial analysis as transportation requirements for the Earth - Gateway orbit. In addition, further mission to the lunar surface can be defined to identify trade off points between different orbits that might be preferable for different combinations of Earth - Gateway, Gateway - Moon flights. For the further analysis a suitable orbit which minimizes the overall ?v demand of the architecture is selected. Based on the calculated required ?v and transport requirements possible launch vehicles and their suitability to the mission are discussed. In addition, an interface minimization approach which considers the number and complexity of interfaces and minimizes the overall complexity of interfaces between different international ground control centers and the individual console positions of the ground control centers is proposed to develop a concept of operations. The developed architecture is then compared to the currently proposed architecture of Gateway where possible and applicable.",ECLSS | Equivalent System Mass | Gateway | Multi Criteria Analysis | Orbit Dynamics,1,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['ECLSS ', ' Equivalent System Mass ', ' Gateway ', ' Multi Criteria Analysis ', ' Orbit Dynamics']",ECLSS | Equivalent System Mass | Gateway | Multi Criteria Analysis | Orbit Dynamics,"Pütz, Daniel;Sabath, Dieter;Söllner, Gerd;Feigl, Andreas;Garhammer, Andreas;Lindig, Niklas"

It is also the first European ISRU (In-situ Resource Utilization) instrument capable of producing liquid water on Mars extracting atmospheric water vapor using salt deliquescence to form a stable liquid brine. HABIT also will study current habitability conditions on Mars investigating the air and surface thermal ranges and UV (Ultraviolet) irradiance. The BOTTLE (Brine Observation Transition To Liquid Experiment) is the container element of HABIT with four independent cells housing deliquescent salts, which have been found on Mars, exposing them to the Martian atmosphere. In order to prevent capillarity of deliquescent or hydrated salts, a mixture of deliquescent salts with Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) based on polyacrylamide is utilized. This mixture has deliquescent and hydrogel properties and can be reused by applying a thermal cycle, complying thus with the purpose of the instrument. A High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) grade filter made of polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) porous membrane sandwiched between spunbounded non-woven fabric stands as a physical barrier allowing interaction between the gaseous molecules of the Martian atmosphere and the salt mixtures, and at the same time preventing the passage of any potential biological contamination from the cells to the outside or vice-versa. In addition to the physical barrier, a strict bioburden reduction and analysis procedure is applied to the hardware and the contained salt mixtures adhering to the European Cooperation for Space Standardization protocol of microbial examination of flight hardware (ECSS-Q-ST-70-55C). The deliquescent salts and the SAP products need to be properly treated independently to adhere to the planetary protection protocols. In this paper, we have described the bioburden reduction process utilized to sterilize the salt mixtures in BOTTLE and the assays adopted to validate the sterilization. The sterilization process involves Dry Heat Microbial Reduction (DHMR) of the deliquescent salts and the SAP mixtures. The performance of SAP after DHMR is validated to ensure its working efficiency after sterilization. A slightly modified version of the standard swab assay is used in the validation process and a comparison is made between samples exposed to a thermal shock treatment and those without thermal shock, to determine the best assay to be applied for future space hardware utilizing such salt mixtures for planetary investigation and ISRU. The demonstration of the compatibility of these products with the processes commonly required for space applications has implications for the future exploration of Mars.",Bioburden assay | Bioburden control | Dry Heat Microbial Reduction | Planetary Protection,0,0,,,DLR,undefined,Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt,SBE,"['Bioburden assay ', ' Bioburden control ', ' Dry Heat Microbial Reduction ', ' Planetary Protection']",Bioburden assay | Bioburden control | Dry Heat Microbial Reduction | Planetary Protection,"Mathanlal, Thasshwin;Nazarious, Miracle Israel;Ramachandran, Abhilash Vakkada;Zorzano, Maria Paz;Martin-Torres, Javier;Rettberg, Petra"

One of the challenges is the lack of oxygen (O2), which makes up only 0.13% of the Martian atmosphere. Not only is this resource necessary for breathing, but it is also needed as a propellant to launch from Mars. Over 2 years, as much as 800 tonnes of O2 would be needed for propellant and to support six astronauts. Considering high transportation costs, shipping the required amount of O2 to Mars would be unfeasible. To address this challenge, our group has designed a process to produce 50 kg/hr of O2 on Mars using in-situ resources, while eliminating toxic by-products. The developed process produces O2 from carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up 95% of Martian atmosphere, and recycles harmful carbon monoxide (CO) by-product into CO2. In the first step of the process, CO2 is separated from Martian air via cryogenic cooling. The CO2 is then sent to an electrolyser unit, where it is electrochemically split into O2 and CO. The CO and CO2 mixture is sent to a membrane separator, where CO2 is separated and recycled to the process. The remaining gas is sent to a fluidized bed reactor, where the CO is treated by reacting with the regolith (Martian soil) to form CO2. Economic analysis was conducted using NASA's Equivalent System Mass (ESM) Analysis. This method accounts for the infrastructure that would need to be shipped in addition to the process itself. To optimize project costs, emphasis was placed on reducing the mass, volume, and power of each piece of equipment, leading to novel designs and solutions. After optimization, the ESM of the process was 60 tonnes, which is 6.8% of the amount of O2 that would need to be shipped to Mars, resulting in over $3 billion saved in shipping costs. A detailed process design including equipment sizing, mass, materials, and power requirements, process flow diagram, piping and instrumentation diagrams, control strategies, and plant layout were delivered as a result of this project. Process optimization resulted in novel designs and heat integration strategies. Environmental impact, maintenance and safety were also analyzed for each step. An implementation plan was proposed based on mass constraints imposed by the developing interplanetary transportation technologies. Lastly, utilization of process by-products was also considered. To conclude, the proposed in-situ O2 production would significantly reduce shipping costs while meeting the O2 demand.",ISRU | Mars | Oxygen production,0,0,,,CSA,undefined,Canadian Space Agency,SBE,"['ISRU ', ' Mars ', ' Oxygen production']",ISRU | Mars | Oxygen production,"Kunitskaya, Alina;Cleland, Keith;Fader, Laura;Nguyen, Anh"

State of the art experiment hardware proven to be successful in space operations and scientific results is therefore a valuable asset for the support of scientific investigations because it offers solutions that are reliable, cost-affordable, and scientific sound. Such space-proved hardware is also an asset for private entities exploiting research results stemming from the space environment (i.e. commercially-driven activities for utilizing space facilities). Kayser Italia (KI) develops space hardware systems and provides mission support for investigations on biological systems in space. Several types of bioreactors (Experimental Units or EU), have been developed. EUs reduce a laboratory into a hand-sized device dedicated to life science research experimentation on space platforms. They allow the autonomous execution of a scientific protocol, being designed to contain the cell culture and all the chemicals required by the experiment. To maintain a desired temperature during the experiment execution an incubator is employed. Driven by the current demand in the commercialization of the space, KI has launched a commercial service called “BIOREACTOR EXPRESS”, which aims to establish an “express” way to perform scientific and/or technological experiments on board the International Space Station (ISS). It offers a large portfolio of bioreactors and biological experiment units complemented by a complete set of experiment containers (Kayser Italia Containers, KIC) providing multiple Levels of Containment (LoC) and embedded or stand-alone control electronics modules for fully automatic execution of biological experiment protocols. Bioreactor Express is a service that exploits the KUBIK incubator facility of the European Space Agency (ESA) which is permanently installed on the Columbus module of the ISS. With this approach several categories of experiments can be performed using available miniaturized bioreactors dedicated to biological, biotechnological and biochemistry experiments. A wider typology of experiments (plant physiology, food production, material science, fluid science, educational, etc.) can also be supported inside KUBIK. Standard units can be adapted to specific requirements since the available hardware portfolio is in continuous evolution and can be used on board several facilities/incubators for microgravity research.",Bioreactors | Commercial Exploitation | International Space Station | Life Science | Microgravity | Research,0,0,,,ESA,undefined,European Space Agency,SBE,"['Bioreactors ', ' Commercial Exploitation ', ' International Space Station ', ' Life Science ', ' Microgravity ', ' Research']",Bioreactors | Commercial Exploitation | International Space Station | Life Science | Microgravity | Research,"Balsamo, Michele;Mariani, Alessandro;Neri, Gianluca;Pieroni, Luca;Zolesi, Valfredo;Zolesi, David;Donati, Alessandro"

Special attention will have to be addressed to these aspects when considering future human permanent settlements on other celestial bodies. Present day manned programs, like the International Space Station (ISS), mainly rely on expendable clothes, heavily contributing to mass and volume budgets of the mission. Conventional washing can largely extend clothes life at the cost of high water consumption. Alternative sanitation techniques currently under investigation, on the other side, are showing higher level of complexity and clothing wearout. In the present paper the possibility of 3D-printing recyclable spacewear on Mars surface to support crew life and activities is assessed. Using 3D-printing unlocks new capabilities that are not provided by traditional technologies: to adapt garments to crew size and needs, to tune physical properties and to unlock unprecedented design opportunities. On top of this, the utilisation of recyclable materials extends clothes lifespan and introduces further advantages, like the opportunity to repair clothes or to transform useless garments into more needed ones. Such a system can also reveal highly compatible with future EVA suits design and manufacturing. A preliminary tradeoff for a ten years mission between disposable clothing, traditional washing and drying and a 3D printing system is presented, based on the Equivalent System Mass concept. The model includes a recycling unit integrated to the 3D printer. Latest advancement in clothes 3D printing on Earth and on ISS were used as a reference. Results obtained show how 3D printing can reach a break-even point against disposable clothes 50% earlier than washing machines, even with higher materials degradation. This is mainly due to net mass and water savings, along with increased flexibility, autonomy and optimization of clothing management strategies. These findings demonstrate how 3D printing of recyclable spacewear can reveal a promising technique in enabling human Mars exploration and in advancing life support technology.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Pino, Paolo;Devecchi, Matteo"

The effort adopts a systems engineering approach to the development of a mathematical model underpinning the design of successful ECLSS systems and outlines strategic synergies with other spacecraft systems. The model details the mass, species and energy balances associated with six key fluids of interest for long-duration, highly closed ECLSS systems including oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water, hydrogen and methane as an energy carrier. The model further incorporates a variable degree of biomass production to supplement caloric requirements of crew members. The model admits varying degrees of in-situ resource utilization to supplement critical fluids, variable leakage rates and degrees of closure within each fluid loop, can accommodate a number of fluid processing technologies and technology improvements, and provides requisite implied energy requirements to accommodate these conditions. Several ECLSS models are developed and discussed for targets of interest for long-duration human exploration missions, including the moon, Mars and Saturn's moon, Titan. Available in-situ resources for each of these targets, and the energy penalties associated with their incorporation into ECLSS fluid cycles can be derived. This provides some critical insights informing design of these future systems. Finally, provisions to include six additional macro-mineral cycles into the framework of the six-fluid model are discussed. These will be critical to the development of a successful biomass production capability essential for long-term ECLSS plants. The macro-minerals of interest are calcium, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus. Inclusion of these compounds in a biomass-producing closed ECLSS system represent a second-order refinement on the six-fluid model, and will provide engineers and mission designers with mission-planning data essential for resupply, supplementation or additional in-situ resource production requirements.",,1,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"White, Daniel"

Electric propulsion systems have been proven effective on large scale satellites (NASA DAWN) with better propellant efficiency than chemical or cold gas propulsion, and if miniaturized can be promising for long term operation of nano-satellites (e.g., CubeSats) in low Earth orbit or in deep space (NASA MarCO). However, the power supplies often used to power these electric thrusters, particularly those involving radiofrequency (RF) plasma, typically comprise power inefficient linear mode RF power amplifiers (e.g., class AB). These are simple systems designed to operate reliably under a wide range of loads for versatility, but they suffer low power efficiencies when operating at conditions significantly different from the nominal operating point. The required bulky and heavy thermal management components deem these electric propulsion systems impossible to fit on board nano-satellites. Here we present a compact and efficient switched mode dc-RF power inverter integrated with an electro-thermal plasma micro-thruster for nano-satellite (e.g., Cubesats) propulsion. The integrated system can serve as side panels and structural support of CubeSats, saving precious on-board volume for propellant and/or payloads. A complete assembly has been operationally tested in a space simulation system.

Scientists around the world are still studying rocks and soil samples that were collected, by the Apollo 11 through 17 missions, using modern equipment, methods and technologies. The return of samples has allowed the field of planetary science to advance in ways unthinkable with the restrictions of in-situ analysis and remote observations. As for every other aspect of the Apollo programme, the design and manufacturing of the tools utilized by astronauts for sample collection had to meet rigorous planetary protection requirements, whilst respecting stringent environmental and operability constraints. Many of those tools went through various redesign efforts, based on feedback from the very skillful and resourceful astronauts using them. In future planetary exploration missions, geological and geo-microbiological sampling will be a key to further development of our understanding of the evolution of the solar system, and to develop successful technologies for in-situ resource utilization and 3D printing. Designing and manufacturing technologies and ergonomics have developed since the 1960s, and so have chemical and biological hazard containment protocols, and analytical tools. Whilst it is important to solidly build on the lessons learned in the Apollo era, there is a serious opportunity for innovative design solutions. The European Space Agency (ESA) Neutral Buoyancy Facility (NBF) based in the European Astronaut Centre (EAC) in Cologne has a large experience in performing 0g simulations for ISS (International Space Station) Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA), and has recently engaged in simulations of Lunar surface operations, replicating reduced gravity and mobility constraints, in order to prepare future human and robotics surface operations. One of the main objectives within this area is prototyping and testing new geological sampling tools which could be used in future human surface Lunar missions. The tools are being developed in cooperation with the team of planetary geologists of the PANGAEA project (Planetary ANalogue Geological and Astrobiological Exercise for Astronauts), and field tested during the PANGAEA Space Analogue test campaigns. This paper discusses the requirements and objectives to be met while developing such tools, the challenges related to EVA suits and Lunar environment which impact the astronauts' mobility and tools performance. It presents the status of development achieved during NBF and PANGAEA analogue field testing. The examples include a variety of sample collectors, containers, markers and the outcome of test performed in various mission scenarios.",Geological samples | Moon | Sampling tools | Surface EVA | Underwater simulations,3,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Geological samples ', ' Moon ', ' Sampling tools ', ' Surface EVA ', ' Underwater simulations']",Geological samples | Moon | Sampling tools | Surface EVA | Underwater simulations,"BudzyÅ„, Dorota;Stevenin, HervÃ©;Maurer, Matthias;Sauro, Francesco;Bessone, Loredana"

A technology demonstration by Made in Space, Inc, proved the reliability of 3D printing in low Earth orbit. The geometric tolerance and mechanical performance of parts 3D printed aboard the International Space Station's Additive Manufacturing Facility are comparable to Earth standards. This foundation of method efficacy substantiates extending the set of materials 3D printed in space to include multi-functional options, such as living cells. The reason to use biology in an additive manufacturing paradigm is scalability, the ability to in perpetuity make many large parts without depleting material stockpiles. This is a risk mitigation strategy. Conventional, non-biological options such as plastic, metal, or ceramics, bottleneck the maximum construction volume based on quantities sent from Earth. A biological feedstock potentiates spontaneous resupply with appropriate care. This increases the speed of an iterative design cycle, a fail fast then pivot strategy to build in isolated environments. Our objective is a technology demonstration to test the utility of proposed additive biomanufacturing method in constructing a functional, replacement part for the ISS water treatment system. Specifically, to 3D print a living filter made of viable sea sponge cells, then test the filter's capacity to remove toxins. The methodology defines four tasks: (1) Characterize the essential attributes that make the sea sponge of interest to NASA, those being filtration and self-regeneration. (2) Computer Aided Design (CAD) of the filter by optimizing high surface area to volume ratios. (3) Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) to prototyping the cell-laden filter using the CAD model. This bioprinting method was translated from successful tissue engineering technique to layer-by-layer build models of human tissue. (4) Test the filtration capability of the prototyped living filter. Results show concept development, but great potential in combining this effort with a biomining approach. Alternatively, cells known to be robust in lab and in space would be genetically reprogrammed to absorb toxins and pollutants. Those genetically engineered cells would be used in place of more sensitive sponge cells. This combined biomining-3D printing technique offers great promise to provide a functional, stable living filter, even more, a scalable additive bio-manufacturing paradigm for space.",3D printing | Biofabrication | In situ resource utilization,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['3D printing ', ' Biofabrication ', ' In situ resource utilization']",3D printing | Biofabrication | In situ resource utilization,"Snyder, Jessica;Lehner, Benjamin;Meyer, Anne;Rothschild, Lynn"

Indigenous or locally cultivated resources lower the mass and volume of payload that needs to be brought from Earth, and as a result decrease the costs. Therefore, an efficient trade-off space has to be created between robotic ISRU systems brought from Earth, and type of materials used in the process to increase the long term mission sustainability. The objective of the current study is to investigate the production process and feasibility of fungal based biocomposite material for habitat structures on the Moon and Mars, using automated additive construction technology. Previous studies have shown that certain types of fungi are able to survive in extreme environmental conditions. Experiments with Î³-radiation in Co-60 facility at ESTEC showed that the chosen model organism, Schizophyllum commune, is able to survive in 20 Gy and 200 Gy dose levels, with the ~30% of colony forming units at 200 Gy. The lower levels of gravity will also not affect the growth of the fungus. Experiments with the random positioning machine (RPM) showed that Schizophyllum commune 227 grows even faster in simulated microgravity conditions than at 1G. The proposed production process of the biocomposite on the Moon or Mars would require cultivating the mycelium of Schizophyllum commune (SC) in-situ from a minimum amount of starter culture brought from Earth. This would be combined with locally grown Azolla filiculoides (AF), an aquatic fern, with the ability to rapidly increase its biomass growing on water, while fixing nitrogen and carbon directly from atmosphere. For an additive construction experiment with a 6-axis robotic arm a mixture of SC mycelium, AF, water and psyllium was used to generate an extractable paste through a nozzle system to fabricate a number of prototypes with different print parameters.",3D printing | Additive manufacturing | Biocomposite | Biomaterials | Fungi | In situ manufacturing | Mycelium | Robotic manufacturing | Space architecture,5,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['3D printing ', ' Additive manufacturing ', ' Biocomposite ', ' Biomaterials ', ' Fungi ', ' In situ manufacturing ', ' Mycelium ', ' Robotic manufacturing ', ' Space architecture']",3D printing | Additive manufacturing | Biocomposite | Biomaterials | Fungi | In situ manufacturing | Mycelium | Robotic manufacturing | Space architecture,"LÃ¤kk, Hanna;Krijgsheld, Pauline;Montalti, Maurizio;WÃ¶sten, Han"

Experimentally, space and planetary conditions are not easily accessible in ground-based laboratories. This especially holds true for space radiation and microgravity. Therefore, performing experiments directly in space allows exposure to real microgravity and overcomes the technical challenge of trying to simulate solar and cosmic radiation on Earth. The Exocube space exposure platform is currently being developed by the European Space Agency as part of a new European Space Exposure Platform for the International Space Station. Exocube will be equipped with a miniaturized Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and a system of LEDs and photodiodes for colorimetric and fluorescent spectrophotometry. One of the main questions Exocube will address is how life at different stages of complexity responds to, and evolves in space and planetary conditions, and what biomolecular mechanisms come into play at the interface between biology and physics. Exocube is aiming to address these questions with far reaching implications for the interpretation of the results of past and upcoming planetary exploration missions. Exocube is part of a new generation of space exposure experiments that monitor experimental parameters in-situ via spectroscopic instrumentation. While leveraging existing cubesat technology from the O/OREOS satellite, Exocube is pushing forward the design and development of in-situ experiments for astrobiology in space. On Exocube, it will be possible to expose living organisms not only to cosmic but also to solar radiation whereas photochemical reactions of organic molecules can be interrogated via infrared spectroscopy. Experiments on Exocube range from exposure of biogenic molecules and protocellular structures to living prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. Well-characterized samples will be exposed to radiation levels in low Earth orbit and microgravity in order to measure in-situ molecular stability via vibrational spectroscopy and biological response via reporter dyes. This will allow us to study in detail the bio-molecular pathways triggered by radiation events and microgravity acting separately and in combination, and will help to identify key molecules and components, that are involved in the adaptation of these organisms to space conditions. Outcomes from the Exocube project will support current and upcoming ESA/NASA planetary and space exploration missions (e.g. ExoMars, Mars2020, JUICE) addressing key questions in the area of radiation biology, planetary protection, biomarker stability, life detection on other planets and biotechnologies for life-support systems.",Astrobiology | Biomarker | In-situ spectroscopy | International Space Station | Membrane molecules | Microorganisms,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Astrobiology ', ' Biomarker ', ' In-situ spectroscopy ', ' International Space Station ', ' Membrane molecules ', ' Microorganisms']",Astrobiology | Biomarker | In-situ spectroscopy | International Space Station | Membrane molecules | Microorganisms,"Elsaesser, A.;Perfumo, A.;Mattioda, A.

To conduct maximally optimized process, choosing the right cultivation system is essential. Although, conventional soil cultivation was tested in some extraterrestrial colony analogues (e.g. Biosphere 2), another type - a soilless cultivation is also popular. It could be divided in two main types. The first one is widely hydroponic, where plants are cultivated in an aqueous semi filled with nutrients. The latter, aeroponic, although less popular, is also beneficial in regard to deep space mission. In this system plants are kept in the air. The nutrient solution is delivered by sprinklers directly to the root system. Hydroponic experiments were widely tested on Earth in a research, not related with space industry, but also in habitat analogues (e.g. BIOS-3, the Integrated Life Support System Test Facility (ILSSTF)) and even on International Space Station (Veggie). However, more complicated aeroponic system has some advantages in comparison with the hydroponic system. This type of cultivation is characterized by lower water and energy consumption, a lower Equivalent System Mass (ESM), and much more efficient plant growth yield. Taking these benefits into account, an aeroponic cultivation might be suitable solution in regard to space travel. To ensure efficient and sustainable aeroponic cultivation in the future extraterrestrial colonies, main research problems must be examined. The microgravity or lower gravity behaviour of droplets released from sprinklers is unknown. While droplets behaviour is influenced by many factors, extensive study in microgravity condition should be considered. Such aspects as: droplets sizes, droplets movement, droplets velocities to ensure sticking to the root are described in this paper. This study has two main aims. Firstly, to provide a broad description of essential factors, which must be considered in development process of the aeroponic system and further examination of such a process in microgravity condition. It shows how some factors might influence the aeroponic system, moreover how to manage them so that the system's work is efficient. Secondly, to show the concept of the experiment to investigate the mentioned above problems in programs such as Parabolic flight or Drop Tower.",Aeroponic | Microgravity experiments | Plants cultivation | Soilless cultivation,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Aeroponic ', ' Microgravity experiments ', ' Plants cultivation ', ' Soilless cultivation']",Aeroponic | Microgravity experiments | Plants cultivation | Soilless cultivation,"KuÅºma, Joanna;Jurga, Anna"

Landing on these bodies is challenging due to the reduced-gravity and airless environment. The correct planning of execution of the trajectory to land on the surface of the body is of cumbersome importance to prevent the vehicle from bouncing up and eventually reach escape velocity. In this paper, a bio-inspired trajectory planning method to land on the surface of a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) with zero relative velocity is proposed. The method is based on Tau theory, which has been demonstrated to explain the way that humans and some other animals’ approach to different target spots to perform tasks such as landing and grasping. We have selected the NEA Apophis asteroid as case study due to its accessibility, small rotational velocity and large period of rotation. Two landing scenarios are studied; one considers the case where the satellite is hovering at a low altitude; the other corresponds to a landing maneuver right after a deorbiting or breaking phase, which will cause residual velocity in the vehicle mainly in the vertical direction. The simulation results show that the introduced approach can achieve zero final relative velocity in both cases for different initial condition, which is a requirement for a soft landing; besides, different kinematic behaviors can be obtained by modifying the single variable, the Tau constant. The particular advantages of the method with respect to a commonly used approach are devised and analyzed as well.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Valenzuela, Rene;Flores-Abad, Angel;Everett, Louis"

For long-Term purposes, it is possible to cultivate genetically modified organisms (e.g., plants) adapted to the Martian conditions for future Martian agriculture to sustain human Mars missions and permanent settlements. The size of the chamber allows preliminary testing of the functionality of space-station mini-models and personal protection devices such as space-suits, covering and building materials and other structures. The reliability of the experimental biotechnological materials can also be tested over a period of years. Complex and thorough research has been performed to acquire the most appropriate technical tools for the accurate engineering of the MCSC and precious programmed simulation of Martian environmental conditions.

Historically, international agreements provided guidelines to prevent contamination of the Moon and other celestial bodies, as well as the Earth (e.g., sample return missions). The UN Outer Space Treaty was established in 1967 and the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) maintains a planetary protection policy complying with Article IX of this treaty. By avoiding forward contamination, the integrity of scientific exploration is preserved. Planetary Protection mission requirements are levied on missions to control contamination. These requirements are dependent on the science of the mission and on the celestial bodies encountered or targeted along the way. Consequently, categories are assigned to missions, and specific implementation plans are developed to meet the planetary protection requirements. NASA missions have evolved over time with increasingly more demanding scientific objectives and more complex flight systems to achieve those objectives and, thus, planetary protection methods and processes used for implementation have become much more intricate, complicated, and challenging. Here, we will portray the evolution of planetary protection implementation at JPL in several important areas throughout the course of NASA sponsored robotic Mars lander or rover missions, starting from Mars Pathfinder through the beginning of Mars 2020. Highlighted in the discussion will be process changes in planetary protection requirements development and flow down. Development and implementation of new and improved methods used in the reduction of spacecraft bioburden will be discussed as well as approaches and challenges that come along with setting up remote laboratories to perform bioassays. The consequences and forward planning of delays on missions will be highlighted as well as lessons learned on the impact of communication and training in achieving planetary protection requirements. The evolution of methods used for the detection of microbial bioburden on spacecraft hardware will be considered. These methods use standard microbiology as well as the adaptation of advances in biotechnology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics.

The critical limiting factor for microbial survival was high-dose UV irradiation. In the tests that simulated a 1-year mission of exposure outside the International Space Station, the core populations of bacteria and yeasts survived and provided protection against UV; however, the microbial density of the populations overall was reduced, which was revealed by implementation of culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.

The exploitation of marker assisted breeding in okra is often limited due to the availability of a few molecular markers, the absence of molecular genetic-map(s), and other molecular tools. Chromosome linkage-groups were not yet constructed for this crop and reports on marker development are very scanty and mostly hovering around cultivar characterization. Besides, very little progress has been observed for transgenic development. However, high throughput biotechnological tools like chromosome engineering, RNA interference (RNAi), marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS), genome-wide selection (GWS), targeted gene replacement, next generation sequencing (NGS), and nanobiotechnology can provide a rapid way for okra improvement. Further, the etiology of many deadly viral diseases like the yellow vein mosaic virus (YVMV) and okra enation leaf curl virus (OELCV) in okra is broadly indistinct and has been shown to be caused by various begomovirus species. These diseases cause systemic infections and have a very effective mode of transmission; thus, preventing their spread has been very complicated.

While not the most important aspect of planning this cislunar outpost, there are several options that should be carefully considered since they may affect the crew as well as mission mass and volume. This study extends an earlier one, which focused on waste disposal options for a Mars Transit Vehicle. In that study, gasifying and venting trash along the way was found to noticeably reduce propellant needs and launch mass, whereas keeping processed trash on board in the form of radiation shielding tiles would significantly lower the crew’s radiation dose during a solar particle event. Another favorable strategy was packing trash in a used logistics module for disposal. Since the DSG does not need much propulsion to maintain its orbit and Orion will be present with its own radiation storm shelter at the Gateway, the driving factors of the waste disposal trade study are different than for the Mars mission. Besides reviewing the propulsion and radiation shielding factors, potential drivers such as mass, power, volume, crew time, and human factors (e.g. smell) were studied. Disposal options for DSG include jettison of a used logistics module containing waste after every human stay, jettison of the same logistics module after several missions once it is full, regular disposal of trash via an airlock, or gasifying waste products for easier disposal or reuse. Conversely, a heat melt compactor device could be used to remove water and stabilize trash into tiles which could be more compactly stored on board and used as radiation shielding. Equivalent system mass analysis is used to tally the benefits and costs (mass, volume, power, crew time) of each case on an equivalent mass basis. Other more subjective factors are also discussed. Recommendations are made for DSG and Mars mission waste disposal.",,4,0,,,NASA,undefined,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,SBE,,,"Ewert, Michael K.;Broyan, James L.;Goodliff, Kandyce E.;Clowdsley, Martha;Singleterry, Robert"

Methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) are increasingly drug-resistant, and thus there is great need for new therapeutics to treat Staph. aureus infections. Attention has focused on potential utility of natural products, such as extracts of marine macroalgae, as a source of novel antimicrobial compounds. The green macroalgae Ulva lactuca produces compounds inhibitory to human pathogens, although the effectiveness of U. lactuca extracts against clinically relevant strains of Staph. aureus is poorly understood. In addition, macroalgae produce secondary metabolites that may be influenced by exogenous factors including lunar phase, but whether lunar phase affects U. lactuca antimicrobial capacity is unknown. We sought to evaluate the antibacterial properties of U. lactuca extracts against medically important Staphylococci, and to determine the effect of lunar phase on antimicrobial activity. We report that U. lactuca methanolic extracts inhibit a range of Staphylococci, and that lunar phase of macrolagae harvest significantly impacts antimicrobial activity, suggesting that antimicrobial properties can be maximized by manipulating time of algal harvest. These findings provide useful parameters for future studies aimed at isolating and characterizing U. lactuca anti-Staphylococcal agents.

In such a system, O2 produced by higher plants is supplied for the breathing of the crew, as well as the respiration of microorganisms which decompose the solid wastes such as inedible plant biomass and human wastes, while CO2 produced by the crew and microorganisms is provided for plants to grow. In the system, an excessively high CO2 level can affect plant growth and may harm human health, however, if the CO2 level is too low, plant growth may also be inhibited. Thus, keeping the balance between CO2 and O2 levels is essential to the gas regulation in the system, and is one of the key points for the operation stability of the system. In this study, an efficient and controllable solid waste bio-convertor was built based on the microbial fermentation in ""Lunar Palace 1"", and the CO2 generation of the bio-convertor under the optimum fermentation conditions in the 105-day airtight experiment was monitored. Moreover, the changes of CO2 production along with increasing or reducing the temperature of the bio-convertor from 33 to 45 °C (or from 45 to 33 °C) were also investigated, and a positive correlation between the CO2 output and the fermentation temperature was obtained accordingly. Therefore, the CO2 production can be adjusted effectively by changing the temperature of the bio-convertor, which implies that it is feasible to regulate the balance between the CO2 and O2 concentrations in BLSS by controlling the fermentation conditions of the solid waste treatment unit.

It is also focused on the technical integration aspect, e.g. which peripheral components have to be adapted when hydrogen is also used for life support technologies and what system mass benefit can be expected.

Molecular marker-assisted breeding (MAB), the application of molecular biotechnologies (DNA markers) to practical breeding and selection, is a novel strategy and a powerful methodology for plant improvement. It has significant advantages compared with conventional breeding methods. Since the 1990s MAB has received increasingly attention and has been extensively used in different crop species. From a plant breeder’s point of view, this chapter addresses the general procedures, theoretical and practical considerations of MAB in plants, including marker-assisted selection (MAS), marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC), marker-assisted gene pyramiding (MAGP), marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS) and genomewide selection (GWS). Applications of individual MAB methods to practical breeding as well as widely used DNA markers are briefly reviewed, and the challenges and perspectives of MAB are discussed. As a new technology, MAB is not a replacement for but a valued supplement to conventional breeding.

As a result, long duration missions may require ECLS subsystems with multiple functions to reduce launch mass and extend mission duration. Recently, the Water Walls Life Support Architecture (WWLSA) has been proposed as an alternative to current ECLS systems using conventional electromechanical and physiochemical technologies. The WWLSA employs passive processes using membrane-based technologies, as well as biological processes to increase overall system reliability. For example, photosynthetic bioregenerative systems using algae would support carbon dioxide (CO2) removal and oxygen (O2) supply, food production, and waste management. An uncharacterized capability of the algae system is its use in environmental thermal control. In this paper, we studied the feasibility of using an algal culture within existing spacecraft cooling loops for controlling or stabilization of the spacecraft cabin thermal environment. This integration would subject the algae to varying temperatures and thermal loads. Thus, an experiment was conducted to investigate algal metabolic response to a cycled thermal environment. Two flasks of cyanobacteria, Spirulina (Athrospira plantensis) were cultured at low light levels (20-40 μmol m-2 s-1); one exposed to a temperature cycle of 8° to 31°C over 54 minutes, the other was kept at a sustained 24°-26°C. The dissolved oxygen content and pH levels were recorded continuously throughout the duration of the experiment. Periodic measurements of cell counts, photosynthetic rates, and respiration rates were used to assess the overall health of the culture. The thermally cycled culture did not proliferate as much as the control, but it did show a carbon use efficiency within the range of the control, indicating a healthy culture. This algal viability during temperature cycling is promising for use in thermal technologies, especially for a “warm” climate species, such as Spirulina.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Matula, Emily E.;Monje, Oscar;Nabity, James A."

This issue can be addressed by in situ resource utilization: producing part or all of these consumables on Mars, from local resources. Biological components are needed, among other reasons because various resources could be efficiently produced only by the use of biological systems. But most plants and microorganisms are unable to exploit Martian resources, and sending substrates from Earth to support their metabolism would strongly limit the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of their cultivation. However, resources needed to grow specific cyanobacteria are available on Mars due to their photosynthetic abilities, nitrogen-fixing activities and lithotrophic lifestyles. They could be used directly for various applications, including the production of food, fuel and oxygen, but also indirectly: products from their culture could support the growth of other organisms, opening the way to a wide range of life-support biological processes based on Martian resources.

This paper presents a thermodynamic analysis of a closed OTEC Rankine cycle. The model used in this paper is based on the work of Martins, using the concept of equivalent Gibbs systems. In an equivalent system, mass, energy and entropy are linked through the Gibbs equation, and the entropy production can easily be expressed in terms of fluxes and their related forces. Assuming linear phenomenological laws, the phenomenological coefficients are assessed from technical data. This method permits the study or design of a lot of process engineering. Moreover, a reliable analysis of the second principle can be realized, in order to compare several processes. This method will be used to analyze the cycle, to determine which components need to be optimized.

Trends are established and comparisons are offered between groups. Findings - Traffic collisions are the leading cause of death for LEOs. Traffic fatalities in the general public have steadily decreased in past decades. This has not been the trend among LEOs. This issue has been studied from several disciplinary perspectives in the social, cognitive, biological, engineering, and natural sciences. While the law enforcement industry has documented the trend, concerted efforts to mitigate the issue have been limited until recently. Practical implications - Law enforcement practitioners and policymakers should take note of research findings and pursue training, policy, and practice changes to limit LEO traffic fatalities and effect an improvement trend consistent with the national reduction in highway deaths.

The method has never before been applied to ancient sediments, but previously published data produced independently by other methods confirmed its applicability and underlying assumptions. The Mn/Fe ratio was unexpectedly high ca. 3.416Ga, implying localised oxidation due to oxygen production by cyanobacteria, but fell dramatically over the interval 3.416-3.298Ga, suggesting mass mortality or mass extinction of early Archaean cyanobacteria owing to asteroid impacts. However, the ratio increased continuously, though at episodically varying rates, from a minimum at ~1.8783Ga to a maximum at ~0.680Ga, signifying accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere and hydrosphere. The rate of increase was relatively high at first but dropped abruptly at some point during the interval 1.8783-1.6Ga, possibly signalling the appearance of eukaryotic herbivores.

Moreover in orbit equatorial orbits result to higher deposition probabilities when compared to polar ones.

Porphyrins (also referred to as tetrapyrroles) are essential for life in the biosphere. Chlorophyll catalyzes the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy via the process of photosynthesis. Organic life in the biosphere is made possible by consumption of the chemical energy generated by photosynthesis. Hemes are the prosthetic groups of cytochromes which are involved in electron transport during oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthetic phosphorylation which generate ATP and NADPH. The latter are essential for many cellular functions. Chlorophyll on the other hands catalyzes the process of photosynthesis. Indeed, life in the biosphere depends on the process of photosynthesis which converts light energy, carbon dioxide and water into the chemical energy, required for the formation of food and fiber. Photosynthetic efficiency is controlled by extrinsic factors such as the availability of water, CO2, inorganic nutrients, ambient temperature and the metabolic and developmental state of the plant, as well as by intrinsic factors (Lien and San Pietro, 1975). The most important intrinsic factor is the efficiency of the photosynthetic electron transport system (PETS). Conventional agriculture is one of the few human activities that have not undergone a revolution to join other activities such as overcoming gravity by flying, and landing on the moon, crossing underwater the polar cap, and communicating wirelessly over long distances via electromagnetic waves. We now feel that enough biochemical and molecular biological knowledge has accumulated to render this dream amenable to experimentation. We believe that the time has come to bioengineer chloroplasts capable of synthesizing a short chain carbohydrate such as glycerol at rates that approach the upper theoretical limits of photosynthesis [Rebeiz, C. A. (2010) Investigations of possible relationships between the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway and the assembly of chlorophyll-protein complexes and photosynthetic efficiency. In: Rebeiz, C. A.

In order to achieve this goal a thorough knowledge of the Chl biosynthetic pathway is needed along with knowledge in other domains (Rebeiz 2010). In this context, this monograph is devoted to an in depth discussion of our present knowledge of the Chl biosynthetic pathway. The complexity and biochemical heterogeneity of the Chl biosynthetic pathway and the relationship of this complexity to the structural and biosynthetic complexity of photosynthetic membranes will be emphasized. We will also emphasize in historical perspective, key stages in our understanding of the Chl biosynthetic heterogeneity. The reader should keep in mind that a complex biosynthetic process is only fully understood when it becomes possible to reconstitute in vitro every step of the process. We are not yet at this stage of understanding of thylakoid membrane biogenesis. Considerable progress has been achieved however, in the understanding of numerous facets of the Chl biosynthetic pathway, namely (a) detection and identification of various major and minor metabolic intermediates (b) precursor-product relationships between various intermediates, (c) structure and regulation of many enzymes of the pathway, and (d) the relationship of the Chl biosynthetic heterogeneity to the structural and functional heterogeneity of thylakoid membranes. In addition topics related to the development of Analytical techniques, Cell-free systems, Herbicides, Insecticides, and Cancericides are also discussed.",,19,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Rebeiz, Constantin A."

But it is not only the power system, which profits from use of hydrogen, but also the life support system, which can contain hydrogen consuming technologies for recycling management (e.g. carbon dioxide removal and waste combustion processes). The paper points out the various fields of hydrogen use in a human spaceflight system. Depending on mission scenarios, shadow phases, and the need of energy storage, regenerative fuel cell systems can be more efficient than secondary batteries. Here, different power storage concepts are compared by equivalent system mass calculation, thus including impact in the peripheral structure (volume, thermal management, etc.) on the space system. It is also focused on the technical integration aspect, e.g. which peripheral components have to be adapted when hydrogen is also used for life support technologies and what system mass benefit can be expected. Finally, a recommendation is given for the following development steps for a synergetic use of hydrogen and fuel cells in human spaceflight power systems.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Belz, S."

Several independent lines of evidence indicate that the parent bodies of the CI1 and CM2 carbonaceous meteorites are most probably the C-type asteroids or cometary nuclei. Several of the protein amino acids detected in the meteorites exhibit chirality and have an excess of the L-enantiomer - such as in the amino acids present in the proteins of all known life forms on Earth. Isotopic studies have established that the amino acids and nucleobases in the CI1 and CM2 carbonaceous meteorites are both indigenous and extraterrestrial. Optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy studies carried out by researchers during the past half century have revealed the presence of complex biogenic microstructures embedded in the rock-matrix of many of carbonaceous meteorites similar to extinct life-forms known as acritarchs and hystrichospheres. Carbonaceous meteorites also contain a wide variety of large filaments that exhibit the complex morphologies and correct size ranges of known genera and species of photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria and diatoms. However, EDAX investigations have shown that these carbon-rich filaments typically have nitrogen content below the level of detection (<0.5% atomic) of the instrument. EDAX studies of living and dead terrestrial biological materials have shown that nitrogen can be detected in ancient mummies and tissue, hair and teeth of Pleistocene Mammoths. Hence, the absence of detectable nitrogen in the filaments provides direct evidence that they do not represent recent biological contaminants that invaded these meteorite stones after they were observed to fall to Earth.

LcERF080 overexpression in Arabidopsis resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes with a higher seed germination rate and transgenic plants with enhanced tolerance to salt stress. Further, under stress conditions, the transgenic lines exhibited elevated levels of soluble sugars and proline as well as relative moisture contents but a lower malondialdehyde content than in control plants. The expression levels of hyperosmotic salinity response genes COR15A, RD22, and P5CS1 were found to be elevated in the LcERF080-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants compared to the wild-type plants.

The aim of this study is to describe the occurrence of redox couples that support prokaryotic life in the system and to obtain representative cultures of predominant microorganisms/metabolisms. Mapping of the area of interest and geochemical analysis of sediments, bedrock and water samples were performed. The original microbial community and enriched cultures were studied by direct count and culturing dependent and independent techniques. In the distal part of the alluvial fans some ponds are found with acidic brines (up to pH 1) of the Cl-SO4-Na (-Mg) type that are surrounded by yellow efflorescences. Other ponds towards the basin center progressively increase in concentration due to capillary evaporation. Brines are rich in aluminium and boron with lower concentration of manganese, lithium, iron and arsenic. An advanced hydrothermal argillic alteration affecting the country rocks, native sulfur associated to active solfataras, alunite and jarosite occurrences in sediments and chloride and sulfate efflorescent salts were evidenced. The microbial community in brines and sediments (105 and 106 cells/mL, respectively) was dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and by Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, respectively. Sulphur and iron oxidation activity were detected depending on the salinity of the samples. Culture enrichments that respire and reduce As (V) and sulfate have been only obtained from sites with the highest pH (4-5).

A major barrier to creating functional tissues, however, has been the inability to monitor the dynamic and complex process of scaffold maturation in real time, making control and optimization extremely difficult. Current methods to assess maturation of bioengineered constructs, such as histology or organ bath physiology, are sample-destructive. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has recently emerged as a key modality for structural assessment of native blood vessels as well as engineered vessel mimics. The objective of this study was to monitor and assess in real time the development of a bioengineered blood vessel using a novel approach of combining both free-space and catheter-based OCT imaging in a new quartz-walled bioreactor. Development of the blood vessel was characterized by changes in thickness and scattering coefficient over a 30-day period. Materials and Methods We constructed a novel blood vessel bioreactor utilizing a rotating cylindrical quartz cuvette permitting free-space OCT imaging of an installed vessel's outer surface. A vascular endoscopic OCT catheter was used to image the lumen of the vessels. The quartz cuvette permits 360 degree, free-space OCT imaging of the blood vessel. Bioengineered blood vessels were fabricated using biodegradable polymers (15% PCL/collagen, ∼300 μm thick) and seeded with CH3 10t1/2 mesenchymal stem cells. A swept-source OCT imaging system comprised of a 20 kHz tunable laser (Santec HSL2000) with 1,300 nm central wavelength and 110 nm FWHM bandwidth was used to assess the vessels. OCT images were obtained at days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 30. Free-space (exterior surface) OCT images were co-registered with endoscopic OCT images to determine the vessel wall thickness. DAPI-stained histological sections, acquired at same time point, were evaluated to quantify wall thickness and cellular infiltration. Non-linear curve fitting of free-space OCT data to the extended Huygen-Fresnel model was performed to determine optical scattering properties. Results Vessel wall thickness increased from 435 ± 15 μm to 610 ± 27 μm and Vessel scattering coefficient increased from 3.73 ±0.32 cm-1 to 5.74 ± 0.06 cm -1 over 30 days. Histological studies showed cell migration from the scaffold surface toward the lumen and cell proliferation over the same time course. The imaging procedure did not have any significant impact on scaffold dimensions, cell migration, or cell proliferation. Conclusions This study suggests that combination of free-space and catheter-based OCT for blood vessel imaging provides accurate structural information of the developing blood vessel. We determined that free-space OCT images could be co-registered with catheter-based OCT images to monitor structural features such as wall thickness or delamination of the developing tissue-engineered blood vessel within a bioreactor. Structural parameters and optical properties obtained from OCT imaging correlate with histological sections of the blood vessel and could potentially be used as markers to non-invasively and non-destructively assess regeneration of engineered tissues in real time.

This paper presents the projected experimental facility which is to be installed at the University of St. Pierre on Reunion Island. A dynamic model of the installation has been developed (on a Delphi interface) by using the concept of equivalent Gibbs systems. In such equivalent system, mass, energy, and entropy are linked through the Gibbs equation, and the entropy production can easily be expressed in terms of fluxes and their related forces. Assuming linear phenomenological laws, the phenomenological coefficients are assessed from technical data. Using a digital tool (Genopt), an optimization study has been conducted in order to determine the best operating parameters according to the temperature of the sea water. This model allows us to anticipate the potential of this technology on Reunion Island.

In situ bioleaching of silicate minerals, such as those found on the moon or Mars, has been proposed as a feasible alternative to traditional extraction techniques that require either extreme heat and/or substantial chemical treatment. In this study, we investigated the biotic and abiotic leaching of basaltic rocks (analogues to those found on the moon and Mars) and the mineral ilmenite (FeTiO3) in aqueous environments under acidic (pHÂ ∼Â 2.5) and circumneutral pH conditions. The biological leaching experiments were conducted using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, an iron (Fe)-oxidizing bacteria, and Pseudomonas mendocina, an Fe-scavenging bacteria. We found that both strains were able to grow using the Fe(II) derived from the tested basaltic rocks and ilmenite. Although silica leaching rates were the same or slightly less in the bacterial systems with A. ferrooxidans than in the abiotic control systems, the extent of Fe, Al and Ti released (and re-precipitated in new solid phases) was actually greater in the biotic systems. This is likely because the Fe(II) leached from the basalt was immediately oxidized by A. ferrooxidans, and precipitated into Fe(III) phases which causes a change in the equilibrium of the system, i.e. Le Chatelier's principle. Iron(II) in the abiotic experiment was allowed to build up in solution which led to a decrease in its overall release rate. For example, the percentage of Fe, Al and Ti leached (dissolvedÂ +Â reactive mineral precipitates) from the Mars simulant in the A. ferrooxidans experimental system was 34, 41 and 13% of the total Fe, Al and Ti in the basalt, respectively, while the abiotic experimental system released totals of only 11, 25 and 2%. There was, however, no measurable difference in the amounts of Fe and Ti released from ilmenite in the experiments with A. ferrooxidans versus the abiotic controls. P. mendocina scavenged some Fe from the rock/mineral substrates, but the overall amount of leaching was small (<2% of total Fe in rocks) when compared with the acidophilic systems. Although the mineralogy of the tested basaltic rocks was roughly similar, the surface areas of the lunar and Mars simulants varied greatly and thus were possible factors in the overall amount of metals released. Overall, our results indicate that the presence of bacteria does not increase the overall silica leaching rates of basaltic rocks; however, the presence of A. ferrooxidans does lead to enhanced release of Fe, Al and Ti and subsequent sequestration of Fe (and other metals) in Fe(III)-precipitates.

Furthermore, effects of mechanical disuse on primitive stem cells that reside in the bone marrow were also included in this review. Novel biomedical solutions using space biotechnology will be required in order to achieve the goal of space exploration without compromising the functions of bone marrow, as spaceflight appears to disrupt homeostasis for all given cell types.",Blood cells | Hematopoetic stem cells | Immunity | Lymphocyte | Monocyte | Stem cell physiology,18,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,SBE,"['Blood cells ', ' Hematopoetic stem cells ', ' Immunity ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Monocyte ', ' Stem cell physiology']",Blood cells | Hematopoetic stem cells | Immunity | Lymphocyte | Monocyte | Stem cell physiology,"Özçivici, Engin"

The tool is implemented using the object orientated programming approach, leading to a modular structure which enables the combination of different LSS technologies and components. The environmentally sensitive dynamic model of the human physiology provides the relevant metabolic inputs and outputs based on internal, environmental, and operational factors. The V-HAB is intended to support the optimization of early LSS architectures with respect to three optimization criteria: the equivalent system mass (ESM), the stability of the LSS, and the crew time required to maintain that LSS. By taking the efficiency of the crew into account, the actual time required for LSS maintenance can be derived. Crew efficiency is influenced by most LSS subsystems as well as the overall mission operations. In turn, it influences the overall mission success and has an impact on the LSS. Hence, crew efficiency is assumed to be a key factor not only for the LSS, but for the overall mission design optimization. It is therefore intended to extend the V-HAB Crew Module to provide a sensor value depicting the crew efficiency quantitatively, in terms of mechanical power provided by the physiology, and qualitatively, in terms of task success probabilities. To achieve this, additional influences on the crew and its performance have to be taken into account. In this paper, an approach towards such an improvement is presented, consisting of three steps: 1) improve the physiological model and interface with other models to depict additional effects like fatigue, 2) include a model covering psychological effects of the crew members and improve V-HAB to provide additional input parameters, 3) create a database to store information about tasks, schedules, boundary conditions, simulation scenarios, and operational influences like operability issues or failure modes.",,1,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Schnaitmann, Jonas"

Optimizing the integrated water recycling systems is essential in any efforts to enable long term space habitation. Membrane aerated biological reactors (MABRs) have proven to be an efficient and sustainable pretreatment process for extra terrestrial wastewater recycling applications in closed loop life support systems. The CoMANDR (Counter-diffusion Membrane Aerated Nitrifying Denitrifying Reactor) system can be used to treat unstabilized wastewater composed of urine, hygiene water, humidity condensate, and laundry water. The operation and assessment of the CoMANDR is in support of the integrated systems test to be implemented by Johnson Space Center pairing a biological reactor with a forward/reverse osmosis unit to treat the aforementioned waste stream. After a two month start up period we have systematically evaluated the CoMANDR performance for a variety of loading rates and verified the operation of the system under pressurized conditions. Results support the ability of the system to effectively reduce organic carbon by over 90% and convert up to 70% of the total influent N to non-organic forms (e.g. NOx or N2). Operation has been demonstrated using both air and pure O2, although in each case further control refinements are required to help maximize the denitrification potential of the reactor. We have also demonstrated that for at least up to 3 weeks, CoMANDR can be put into recycle and brought back on line with no start up required supporting the ability to intermittently operate the system.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Christenson, Dylan;Morse, Audra;Jackson, W.

Following the Operations And Service Infrastructure for Space (OASIS) project, this paper describes in greater details the establishment and development of the second node of the network, on the Moon. Node 2 is based in the Lunar South Pole, where trapped water in craters, almost constant illumination on the craters' rim, and small temperature gradients offer the best environment. Initially unmanned, the lunar outpost is composed of a spaceport to land and launch vehicles safely, a power plant, and an in situ resources processing plant. Water is extracted and sent to node 1 in Low Earth Orbit and is also separated on site into hydrogen and oxygen, which can be used as propellant for various spacecraft and to support habitation and human operations. Other lunar volatiles trapped in the near sub surface include N 2, usable for habitat atmosphere generation and for plant growth medium, H2, and other carbon compounds. Additionally ilmenite, a common lunar mineral, can be used to produce titanium, oxygen and manufacture semiconducting devices such as photovoltaic cells. Critical technologies, such as regolith excavators and the Moon shuttle, with their concepts of operations, requirements, functions, and design are detailed. The business model and rationale for node 2 in the frame of the network of spaceports, as well as the law and policy framework are described comprehensively.

An efficient and reliable LSS is of high importance for assembling a future research base on the Moon and for further human space exploration missions beyond Low Earth Orbit. Because of longer distance to Earth and longer transfer times new requirements appear for LSS operation and functionality in comparison to the International Space Station. The minimization of resupply mass is a crucial factor to cope with this challenge. Regenerating the main media oxygen, water, and carbon as well as demonstrating a closed loop are essential milestones for an efficient and sustainable LSS. The logical step between partly regenerative physico-chemical and bioregenerative LSS is a so-called hybrid LSS characterized by the crosslinked integration of physico-chemical and simple biological system components. The Institute of Space Systems of the University of Stuttgart (IRS), the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics (ITT) of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and the Fraunhofer-Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology (IGB) work together in a project on advanced LSS research and development. The IRS will investigate the integration of a photobioreactor (PBR) for algae cultivation as biological component and a reversible proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEFC) as physico-chemical component into an LSS. Algae in the PBR absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by the crew and produce biomass (food) and oxygen under light influence. The oxygen can be directed either into the crew cabin or into the fuel cell for generating electricity. Vice versa the electrolysis process splits water (from the PBR or the fuel cell process) into oxygen and hydrogen used as energy storage or propellant. Main task at IRS is a feasibility study on the mentioned technologies, considering the capability of media and product regeneration as well as the ability of integration of the components into a system. Synergies, mass reduction, dissimilar redundancy, and safety enhancement must be taken into account in order to specify integration problems and filtration costs. The IGB supports this study by its expertise in PBR operation, algae cultivation, and algae species selection. The ITT investigates the coupling of the PBR with three different fuel cell types: namely PEFC, SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell), and AFC (Alkaline Fuel Cell) under electrochemical performance aspects. The influence of PBR products on performance and lifetime of the different fuel cells is of high interest.

Process technologies to be covered include chemical pretreatment, biological urea hydrolysis, chemical urea hydrolysis, combined nitrification-denitrification, nitrate nitrification, anammox denitrification, and regenerative ammonia absorption through struvite formation. Biological processes are considered mainly for their ability to both maximize water recovery and to produce nutrients for future plant systems. Unit operations can be considered for traditional equivalent system mass requirements in the near term or what they can provide downstream in the form of usable chemicals or nutrients for the long term closed-loop ecological control and life support system.

The design goal is to provide the needed life support performance with the required ultra reliability for the minimum Equivalent System Mass (ESM). Recycling life support systems used with multiple redundancy can have sufficient reliability for deep space missions but they usually do not save mass compared to mixed storage and recycling systems. The best deep space life support system design uses water recycling with sufficient water storage to prevent loss of crew if recycling fails. Since the amount of water needed for crew survival is a small part of the total water requirement, the required amount of stored water is significantly less than the total to be consumed. Water recycling with water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide removal material storage can achieve the high reliability of full storage systems with only half the mass of full storage and with less mass than the highly redundant recycling systems needed to achieve acceptable reliability.

Current primary water processes recover greater than 90% of the water in wastewater and produce highly contaminated brine. Additional water recovery has been limited by the high level of solids in urine, one of the largest wastewater sources, because inorganic solids reach saturation levels and precipitate while organic solids tend to form sticky pastes that foul equipment and impede water removal. This paper describes a microgravity-compatible Advanced Air Evaporation System (AAES) for reclaiming nearly 100% of water from brine without concern for these solids. This novel approach utilizes hydrophilic ceramic fabrics, felts, or fibers as a refractory wicking material. Water is evaporated from brine-saturated ceramic wicks in a drying chamber resulting in the recovery of water vapor by condensation while brine solids accumulate on ceramic wicks. Several sub-processes are utilized to regenerate these wicks. After each drying cycle, organic solids are removed by thermal oxidation leaving inorganic salts on the wick. Additional brine may then be processed using the partially regenerated wick. Following several oxidation cycles, inorganic salts are removed by elutriation with water forming a saturated salt solution and a fully regenerated wick. This initial two-step regeneration cycle recovers 78% of the water from the brine with the remaining water forming the salt solution. Recovery of the remaining water from the salt solution without the presence of organic solids is a straightforward process and the resultant overall water recovery will approach 100%. Future development of the AAES will enable increased water recovery, reduced resupply logistics, improved reliability, and lowered Equivalent System Mass (ESM) for water recycling during future space missions. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Akse, James R.;Wilson, Geoffrey A."

Current technologies on the International Space Station regenerate water and enable oxygen generation by water electrolysis. Further steps would require oxygen generation from carbon dioxide and on-board food production. The following study summarizes technologies to be used for advanced life support architecture and analyzes life support strategies by a different degree of synergetic integration and closure of loops. Especially atmosphere revitalization and food generation can be realized by a combination of existing technologies with new processes. Life support systems based on physicochemical, bioregenerative and hybrid components are modeled, and a permanently crewed lunar base on the near-side of the Moon equator and a mission to Mars are taken as long term reference missions for time resolved life support system simulations.

It is also now well established by deuterium/hydrogen ratios that the CI1 carbonaceous meteorites contain indigenous extraterrestrial water. The evidence of extensive aqueous alteration of the minerals in these meteorites led to the hypothesis that water-bearing asteroids or comets represent the parent bodies of the CI1 (and perhaps CM2) carbonaceous meteorites. These meteorites have also been shown to possess a diverse array of complex organics and chiral and morphological biomarkers. Stable isotope studies by numerous independent investigators have conclusively established that the complex organics found in these meteorites are both indigenous and extraterrestrial in nature. Although the origin of these organics is still unknown some researchers have suggested that they originated by unknown abiotic mechanisms and may have played a role in the delivery of chiral biomolecules and the origin of life on Early Earth. In this paper we review these results and investigate the thermal history of comets. We show that permanent as well as transient domains of liquid water can be maintained on a comet under a plausible set of assumptions. With each perihelion passage of a comet volatiles are preferentially released and during millions of such passages the comet could shed crustal debris that may survive transit through the Earth's atmosphere as a carbonaceous meteorite. We review the current state of knowledge of comets and carbonaceous meteorites. We also present the results of recent studies on the long-term viability of terrestrial ice-microbiota encased in ancient glacial ice and permafrost. We suggest that the conditions which have been observed to prevail on many comets do not preclude either survivability (or even the active metabolism and growth) of many types of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbial extremophiles-including algae cyanobacteria bacteria and archaea.

Likely, many of these resources such as water or oxygen can best be liberated from in situ material by conventional physical and chemical processes. However, there is one critical resource required for human life that can only be produced in quantity by biological processes: high-protein food. Here, recent data concerning the materials available on the Moon and common asteroid types is reviewed with regard to the necessary materials to support the production of food from material in situ to those environments. These materials and their suitability as feedstock for the biological production of food are reviewed in a broad and general way such that terminology that is often a barrier to understanding such material by interdisciplinary readers is avoided. The waste products available as in situ materials for feasibility studies on the International Space Station are also briefly discussed. The conclusion is that food production in space environments from in situ material proven to exist there is quite feasible. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Asteroid | Astrobiology | Biomineralogy | Cyanobacteria,41,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Asteroid ', ' Astrobiology ', ' Biomineralogy ', ' Cyanobacteria']",Asteroid | Astrobiology | Biomineralogy | Cyanobacteria,"Montague, Michael;McArthur, George H.;Cockell, Charles S.;Held, Jason;Marshall, William;Sherman, Louis A.;Wang, Norman;Nicholson, Wayne L.;Tarjan, Daniel R.;Cumbers, John"

Reheating of food and stabilization of waste have been successfully done in the past using a V-shaped electrode pouch using pulsed ohmic heating, however improvement of field distribution was needed. The main goals of this work were to develop an improved pouch design to facilitate uniform ohmic heating of food; to model ohmic sterilization within the pouch; and to verify the model through an inoculated pack study. The pouch was redesigned to improve the electric potential distribution and hence heating uniformity. A temperature distribution study on a pouch with 227 g of tomato soup showed the presence of cold regions at the non-electrode sides due to channeling of current through a hotter and more conductive centre. A much more uniform temperature distribution was obtained the use of two external strip heaters installed along these sides. The ohmic heating process inside the pouch was simulated in 3D to predict possible cold and hot spots. The simulated heating profile was in good agreement with the measured values confirming the efficacy of the model. An inoculated pack study using Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores (ATCC 5973) confirmed the mathematical model.

The module would be a hybrid of deployable (CLASS II) and in-situ built (CLASS III) structures. It would combine deployable membrane structures and pre-integrated rigid elements with a sintered regolith shell for enhanced radiation and micrometeorite shielding. The closed loop ecological system would support a sustainable presence on the Moon with particular focus on research activities. The core module accommodates from four to eight people, and provides laboratories as a test bed for development of new lunar technologies directly in the environment where they will be used. SinterHab also includes an experimental garden for development of new bio-regenerative life support system elements. The project explores these various concepts from an architectural point-of-view particularly, as they constitute the building, construction and interior elements. The construction method for SinterHab is based on 3D printing by sintering of the lunar regolith. Sinterator robotics 3D printing technology proposed by NASA JPL enables construction of future generations of large lunar settlements with little imported material and the use of solar energy. The regolith is processed, placed and sintered by the Sinterator robotics system which combines the NASA ATHLETE and the Chariot remotely controlled rovers. Microwave sintering creates a rigid structure in the form of walls, vaults and other architectural elements. The interior is coated with a layer of inflatable membranes inspired by the TransHab project. The life-support system is mainly bio-regenerative and several parts of the system are intrinsically multifunctional and serve more than one purpose. The plants for food production are also an efficient part of atmosphere revitalization and water treatment. Moreover, the plants will be used as a winter garden for psychological and recreational purposes. The water in the revitalization system has a multifunctional use, as radiation shielding in the safe-haven habitat core. The garden module creates an artificial outdoor environment mitigating the notion of confinement on the lunar surface. Fiber optics systems and plasma lamps are used for transmission of natural and artificial light into the interior. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

'Whatley-Loretan' was developed for space life support by researchers at Tuskegee University for its highly productive, nutritious storage roots. This promising candidate space life-support crop has a sprawling habit and aggressive growth rate in favorable environments that demands substantial growing area. Shoot pruning is not a viable option for vine control because removal of the main shoot apex drastically inhibits storage-root initiation and development, and chemical growth retardants typically are not cleared for use with food crops. As part of a large effort by the NASA Specialized Center of Research and Training in Advanced Life Support to reduce equivalent system mass (ESM) for food production in space, the dilemma of vine management for sweetpotato was addressed in effort to conserve growth area without compromising root yield. Root yields from unbranched vines trained spirally around wire frames configured either in the shapes of cones or cylinders were similar to those from vines trained horizontally along the bench, but occupying only a small fraction of the bench area. This finding indicates that sweetpotato is highly adaptable to a variety of vine-training architectures. Planting a second plant in the growth container and training the two vines in opposite directions around frames enhanced root yield and number, but had little effect on average length of each vine or bench area occupied. Once again, root yields were similar for both configurations of wire support frames. The 3-4-month crop-production cycles for sweetpotato in the greenhouse spanned all seasons of multiple years during the course of the study, and although electric lighting was used for photoperiod control and to supplement photosynthetic light during low-light seasons, there still were differences in total light available across seasons. Light variations and other environmental differences among experiments in the greenhouse had more effects on vine length than on root yield. Average vine length correlated positively with total hours of daylight received across seasons, and responses for one plant per container were higher above a threshold duration of solar exposure, suggesting that the vines of two plants per container compete for available light. In addition to the adaptability of sweetpotato to various vine-training architectures and across seasons in terms of maintaining root productivity, the open, interior volumes of the support frames tested in this study will provide future opportunity to enhance sweetpotato root yield in space by adding novel interior lighting, such as from intracanopy arrays of light-emitting diodes.

The study used a representative exploration mission with well understood parameters to support the trade. Additional sensitivity studies were performed to ensure the applicability of study results across varying systems and destinations. Results from the study indicate that replacing a wax PCM heat sink with a water ice PCM heat sink has the potential to decrease the equivalent system mass of the mission's vehicle through a combination of a smaller heat sink and a slight 5% increase in radiator size or the addition of a lightweight heat pump. An evaluation of existing and emerging PCM heat sink technologies indicates that further mass savings should be achievable through continued development of those technologies.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey and analysis of the various life support systems needed for lunar habitation and how they can be incorporated into a lunar outpost. The most vital life support issues in the lunar environment consist of isolation and insulation from the exterior atmosphere, temperature regulation, and adequate radiation shielding, most of which are addressed and investigated.

Success was demonstrated by effective stabilization of a large number of composite urine samples using low concentrations of non-oxidizing biocides. The pretreatment formula contains a quaternary amine and sodium benzoate as primary and secondary biocides, and an organic acid for acidification. The nonhazardous nature of the urine pretreatment constituents is exemplified by the approval of the quaternary amine for human use as a biocide, the acceptance of sodium benzoate as an antifungal agent in food, and the use of organic acids as food preservatives. Urine pretreatment in use aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is based upon the strong oxidant, hexavalent chromium, and operates at a pH < 1.8, which necessitates triple containment. This carcinogenic oxidant generates harmful oxidation products in urine and is rapidly rendered inactive by oxidation-reduction reactions. In comparison, the nonhazardous urine pretreatment chemicals are stable and safe to handle with benign storage and use requirements. These characteristics will lower urine pretreatment Equivalent System Mass (ESM) by decreasing containment volume and mass, expendable chemical mass, system complexity, and crew time needed to handle pretreatment chemicals. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

This approach allows for a quantitative comparison of diverse technologies within a given system by converting factors such as volume, power consumption, and crew time into units of mass representing a means of comparing relative launch costs between the different solutions. This ESM methodology is explained and applied to the legacy sublimator, Spacesuit Water Membrane Evaporator (SWME), integrated electrochromic radiator concepts, Sub-Cooled Phase Change Material (SPCM), and an evaporator/absorber/radiator concept with infrastructure costs (conversion factors) based on lunar surface missions. Each candidate technology is sized for an 8-hour EVA with a nominal heat load. Results indicate that all of the non-venting technologies reach a break-even point with the water-venting technologies within 12 or fewer EVAs, with the electrochromic and absorber concepts reaching the break-even point after a single EVA. However, since this ESM analysis depends on low TRL data for many of the technologies still being developed, as well as NASA-supplied infrastructure costs that are periodically revised as baseline mission architectures change with vehicle capabilities and programmatic goals, these results are meant to serve as a precursor, not a substitute, for a comprehensive trade study that should consider technology maturity, reliability, development costs, specific mission requirements, and other factors. © 2011 by Jonathan G.

203,203,2-s2.0-84880583645,,,,System concepts to reduce logistics requirements for space exploration,cp,Conference Paper,Pestak C.,60026097,Battelle,Columbus,United States,2.0,"Pestak, Christopher J.;Wegeng, Robert S.",36601122100;6602802640,60026097;60026097,2011-12-01,2011,AIAA SPACE Conference and Exposition 2011,,21100246527.0,,Conference Proceeding,,,,,"Because of the high cost to transport mass to the Moon, Mars, or a Near Earth Object (NEO), the logistics of space exploration are a major cost driver that can make or break a sustainable exploration program, whether that program be based on human exploration, robotic exploration, or some combination of the two. For a comprehensive campaign of space exploration to be successful and sustainable, new logistics methodologies and systems to support them must be developed. Battelle has developed conceptual designs that can greatly reduce the logistics requirements for long-term campaigns of space exploration. This paper describes two of these concepts and how they can be used to achieve reductions in space logistics requirements. The two concepts presented are: 1) thermal energy reservoirs that utilize processed lunar regolith to produce heat and electrical power; and 2) an ultra-efficient human exploration architecture that couples closed loop life support with the production of food and/or fuels that can be utilized for propulsion and power generation. While these two concepts are very different, they share a common philosophy of using inputs (gasses, materials, etc.) that would be considered by many to be unusable waste products. In any space exploration endeavor, where the cost of forward deploying basic resources such as air, water, food, and fuel is extremely high, resources must be conserved to the maximum extent possible to keep the costs of the exploration campaign from becoming prohibitively expensive. To accomplish this, the elements of the system of systems that will comprise the exploration infrastructure must be designed to complement each other so that one system's byproducts are the feedstock for other systems. The first conceptual design utilizes materials produced as waste byproducts of oxygen production from a lunar In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) system to be configured as thermal reservoirs for the storage and dumping of heat. The concept also uses a spent lunar lander, after it has completed its primary mission of delivering payloads to the lunar surface, to function as a power generation station. In this concept, the waste material from the ISRU process would be loaded into the lunar lander's propellant tanks and configured to function as heat sources and intermediate heat sinks. During periods of sunlight, solar energy would be concentrated and stored as thermal energy in high temperature, thermal energy reservoirs and then used for power generation during periods of darkness through the use of Stirling cycle heat engines, intermediate heat sinks, and radiators. In the reference design, where both the heat sources and the intermediate heat sinks make use of the propellant tanks, a net power generation of 8.0 kWe was calculated to be available - using the tankage of one baselined Altair Lunar Lander - throughout the longest period of darkness currently anticipated at Site A of Shackleton Crater, a possible site of a manned and robotic lunar outpost. For each trip to the Moon that leaves behind one lander, an additional thermal energy storage and power generation capacity of 8 kWe could be achieved. The second conceptual design described in this paper utilizes two advanced technologies under development at Battelle: Microchannel Process Technology (MPT) and Photolytically Driven Electro-Chemistry (PDEC) technology. MPT enables the manufacturing of very small and highly efficient components for chemical processing and heat exchanger systems. PDEC technology is bio-inspired by the photosynthesis process occurring in green plants but, unlike photosynthesis, uses robust industrial (non-biological) materials such as metals, ceramics, plastics, and the like, in a rugged configuration suitable for use in harsh environments. PDEC is a platform technology with many potential applications, and is especially well-suited for use in closed-loop life support systems. The integrated MPT-PDEC system will be configured to use light energy to simultaneously generate oxygen and electrical energy while removing CO2 and water from the breathing atmosphere. Like photosynthesis, the system can use CO2 and water to create useful byproducts, which can include: a) food stuffs that are easily stored and can be consumed by astronauts to supplement their nutritional needs; and b) fuels that can be stored and used as propellant or for power production. Both of these systems will be described in terms of their potential to significantly reduce the logistics requirements for exploration of the Moon, Mars, and NEOs. © 2011 by Battelle Memorial Institute.

It is also now well established by deuterium/hydrogen ratios that the CI1 carbonaceous meteorites contain indigenous extraterrestrial water. The evidence of extensive aqueous alteration of the minerals in these meteorites led to the hypothesis that water-bearing asteroids or comets represent the parent bodies of the CI1 (and perhaps CM2) carbonaceous meteorites. These meteorites have also been shown to possess a diverse array of complex organics and chiral and morphological biomarkers. Stable isotope studies by numerous independent investigators have conclusively established that the complex organics found in these meteorites are both indigenous and extraterrestrial in nature. Although the origin of these organics is still unknown, some researchers have suggested that they originated by unknown abiotic mechanisms and may have played a role in the delivery of chiral biomolecules and the origin of life on Early Earth. In this paper we review these results and investigate the thermal history of comets. We show that permanent as well as transient domains of liquid water can be maintained on a comet under a plausible set of assumptions. With each perihelion passage of a comet volatiles are preferentially released, and during millions of such passages the comet could shed crustal debris that may survive transit through the Earth's atmosphere as a carbonaceous meteorite. We review the current state of knowledge of comets and carbonaceous meteorites. We also present the results of recent studies on the long-term viability of terrestrial ice-microbiota encased in ancient glacial ice and permafrost. We suggest that the conditions which have been observed to prevail on many comets do not preclude either survivability (or even the active metabolism and growth) of many types of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbial extremophiles-including algae, cyanobacteria, bacteria and archaea. It is argued that the chemical and morphological biomarkers detected on comets and carbonaceous meteorites can be explained by ancient microbial activity without the need to invoke unknown abiotic production mechanisms. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",Carbonaceous Meteorites | Chiral Biomolecules | Comets | Extremophiles | Ice-ce-Microbiota | Meteorites,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Carbonaceous Meteorites ', ' Chiral Biomolecules ', ' Comets ', ' Extremophiles ', ' Ice-ce-Microbiota ', ' Meteorites']",Carbonaceous Meteorites | Chiral Biomolecules | Comets | Extremophiles | Ice-ce-Microbiota | Meteorites,"Wickramasinghe, N.

Because the environment at the time of ejecta impact was in the initial stage of seral vegetative development as wet tundra, part of the clay/organic balls, classic 'house of cards' form, which constitute a portion of the sediment complex, may be of cosmic origin.

With NASA's goal to place human explorers on Mars, identification of cladding materials with appropriate optical and physical properties that can withstand the high ultraviolet radiation, low pressure, and low temperature Martian environment is necessary for greenhouse design. The objective of this study was to develop methods for evaluating the effects of simulated Mars environmental conditions on the transmissivity and mechanical strength of candidate greenhouse cladding materials. The University of Florida's Mars Simulation Chamber was utilized to expose material samples to simulated Mars environmental conditions. Changes in control versus exposed material sample transmissivities were measured using a spectroradiometer over a range of wavelengths from 200 to 800 nm and material peak yield stresses were determined using an Instron universal testing machine. Results indicated that, under Mars simulated environmental conditions for 42 Mars equivalent days, materials experienced a reduction in transmission in the photosynthetically active region and a decrease in material strength. In short, the methods developed in this study provide a means for evaluating the transmissivity and strength of candidate greenhouse cladding materials under Mars environmental conditions for the determination of their suitability in greenhouse design. © 2011 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.",Mars greenhouse | Plastics | Strength of materials | UV transmittance,2,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Mars greenhouse ', ' Plastics ', ' Strength of materials ', ' UV transmittance']",Mars greenhouse | Plastics | Strength of materials | UV transmittance,"Smith, Samantha J.;Townley, Justin A.;Martin-Ryals, Ana D.;Truett, John;Palaia IV, Joseph E.;Schuerger, Andrew C.;Bucklin, Ray A.;Correll, Melanie J."

Equivalent System Mass (ESM) of crew clothing and hygiene towels was estimated at about 11% of total life support system ESM for a 4-crew, 10-year Lunar Outpost mission. Ways to lessen this penalty include: reduce clothing supply mass through using clothes made of advanced fabrics, reduce daily usage rate by extending wear duration and employing a laundry with reusable clothing. Lunar habitat atmosphere pressure and therefore oxygen volume percentage will be different from Space Station or Shuttle. Thus flammability of clothing must be revisited.

Many magnetic particles are largely produced as a result of microbial iron metabolism, e.g., the low temperature Banded Iron Formations - formed as a result of microbial activity in contrast to the similar high temperature formations. The microbial origins of the Banded Iron Formations are a fact that has only recently (in the last 30 years) been realized by mainstream science. Particles of the mineral magnetite are among the most magnetic that occur in nature. Magnetite is one of the most common products of microbial iron metabolism, and it is, therefore, also a highly abundant mineral. In addition to being a common end-product of microbial metabolism, magnetite is also known to be incorporated into specialized organelles termed ""magnetosomes."" These small magnets are used for direction sensing by certain species of bacteria, i.e., magnetotactic bacteria. The presence of magnetite in a Martian meteorite (ALH84001) was even touted as evidence for life on Mars. Yet magnetite particles are also of interest in biotechnology for everything from cell selection, e.g., stem cell tracking, differentiation and biosensing, to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent to drug screening. Microbiallyproduced, nano-sized magnetite crystals are highly ordered minerals consistent in size and morphology - characteristics that lend these particles well to nano- and biotechnological applications.

Aboard the I SS, the Volatile Removal Assembly (VRA) is a catalytic reactor that oxidizes organic contaminants that are poorly removed by the Water Processor Assembly (WPA) primary adsorption and ion exchange purification beds in order to lower the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) level below NASA potable water specifications. VRA contribution to WPA energy use is significant due to the operating temperature and pressure (129°C and 65 psig). This paper describes the use of combinatorial methods to develop advanced aqueous oxidation catalysts capable of operating at significantly lower temperature and pressure, thereby lowering WPA Equivalent System Mass (ESM). Several elements characterize combinatorial catalyst optimization. First, a combinatorial catalyst library was created containing 168 different combinations of seven noble metals and three supports. Then, fluorescein, a dye, was utilized for rapid screening of oxidation activity. This method identified ten catalysts with superior activity than the VRA catalyst. One bimetallic and five trimetallic catalysts were selected for additional testing against a challenge solution containing 200-mg/L of TOC. A trimetallic noble metal catalyst supported on a ZrO2-CeO2 support exhibited the highest oxidation activity. The results of this program confirmed the usefulness of combinatorial methods for catalyst optimization and extension of this approach is expected to result in catalysts capable of oxidizing the VRA influent contaminants at temperatures below 70°C and at reduced pressure. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

To maintain the welfare of a crew during future missions, a host of life support technology is required. These technologies are responsible for oxygen and water generation, removal of carbon dioxide and trace concentrations of organic contaminants, water recovery, and solid waste disposal. For each particular life support subsystem, a variety of competing technologies either exist or are under aggressive development efforts. Each individual technology has strengths and weaknesses with regard to launch mass, power and cooling requirements, volume of hardware and consumables, and crew time requirements for operation. However, from a system-level perspective, the favorability of each life support architecture is better assessed when the subsystem technologies are analyzed in aggregate. We employed the measure of equivalent system mass (ESM) to evaluate each specific life support system architecture as a measure of favorability. The results discussed herein are presented from the context of loop-closure with respect to the air, water, and waste subsystems. Specifically, closure relates to the regenerative capabilities of the life support system in which a fully closed life support system completely regenerates all water and gas commodities supplied during launch. The results described herein demonstrate the optimal level of loop closure is heavily dependent on mission requirements such as duration and the level of extravehicular activity performed. Subsystem-level trades were also considered as a function of mission duration to assess when increased loop closure was practical. Although many additional factors will likely merit consideration in designing life support systems for future missions, the ESM results described herein provide a context for future architecture design decisions as mission specifications are refined.",,10,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Swickrath, Michael J.;Anderson, Molly S.;Bagdigian, Bob M."

The objectives of these missions include using the Moon as a steppingstone towards crewed missions to Mars, to test advanced technology, and to further exploration of the Moon for scientific research and in-situ resource utilization. To meet these objectives, it will be necessary to establish and operate a lunar base. As a result, a wide variety of tasks that may pose a number of crew health and safety risks will need to be performed on the surface of the Moon. Therefore, to ensure sustainable human presence on the Moon and beyond, it is essential to anticipate potential risks, assess the impact of each risk, and devise mitigation strategies. To address this, a nine week intensive investigation was performed by aninternational, interdisciplinary and intercultural team on how to maximize crew safety on the lunar surface through a symbiotic relationship between astronauts and robots. To identify if and how robotic systems may be employed to enhance safety, it was necessary to establish a standardized risk assessment criteria. Risk assessment criteria used by space agencies and health and safety institutions from around the world were combined and integrated to meet this requirement. In addition, a decision tree was developed to rapidly identify robotic platforms that will enhance crew safety during tasks that require astronaut participation. Using these tools it was possible to appropriately identify the impact of each riskon crew safety in terms of the probability of occurrence (likelihood) and consequence (severity), and generate a list of robotic platforms to improve crew safety. Furthermore, the risk assessment criteria and robotic decision tree are extensible to lunar and Mars exploration missions regardless of mission architecture. © 2009 SAE International.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Mulugeta, Lealem;Bodkin, David;Chasseigne, Romain;Demel, Michael;Jagula, Dexter;Turnock, Matthew"

The Enhanced Brine Dewatering System (EBDS) is being developed to allow nearly complete recovery of water from wastewater brines. This paper describes the operation of the EBDS and discusses the development and testing of two EBDS full system prototypes. The alpha prototype was used to process ersatz solutions that represent the anticipated wastewater stream from a primary stage water processor, and to evaluate the effects of different additives that are mixed with the brine to improve the ability of the EBDS to generate a removable solid residue. In addition to processing ersatz formulations, the alpha prototype processed authentic brines generated by the Cascade Distillation System (CDS) with a wastewater stream made up of actual treated urine, hygiene water, and condensate water. The chemical and microbial composition of the EBDS influent solutions, dried solid residue, and condensed effluent were evaluated. The beta prototype was tested with a wastewater brine ersatz to evaluate system performance, including power requirements. The performance test results were used to evaluate the equivalent system mass of flight-like EBDS designs for a number of reference missions. © 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Mission duration of two years and longer, and the large distance from Earth to Mars are the main drivers in LSS design. A Modular Mars Mission (M3) concept suggests the development of an Earth-to-Orbit transportation system, a Mars Transfer Vehicle (MTV) and a Mars Excursion Vehicle. The MTV consists of a pressurized module for the crew and contains the LSS during transit time. To meet the requirements of long-term missions a combination of physico-chemical and biological components is proposed. A synergetic hybrid LSS with integrated Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) and algae photobioreactors (PBR) is investigated. It contributes to partial closing of the main mass loops of oxygen, water and carbon and enables crew self-sufficiency as well as less dependence on resupply. It takes advantage of a high-level technology integration approach so that a common use of resources by different MTV subsystems is possible. The integration approach is realized by a resource specific infrastructure. Air or oxygen supply is directly connected with the crew cabin and the PEMFC. The PBR is a highly controllable biological component which converts carbon dioxide exhaled by the crew into oxygen and edible biomass if illumination is provided. The Mars transit scenario is modelled and simulated with the software ELISSA (Environment for Life Support Systems Simulation and Analysis), developed at the Institute of Space Systems, University of Stuttgart. System behaviour (mass, volume, power and heat) with integrated hardware components afford essential cost results. A trade-off study is performed for synergetic hybrid LSS, a physicochemical synergetic LSS and a conventional physico-chemical LSS. The study contains Equivalent System Mass calculations as well as system reliability analysis. Reliability is a very important aspect of crew safety. Reliability is calculated by Monte Carlo simulation with a Weibull approximation for failure probabilities due to complex interconnections between LSS components.

The Coflex-F is a recently developed interspinous spacer, the makers of which claim that it can provide stabilization similar to pedicle screw fixation. Therefore, this study compares the biomechanical behavior of the Coflex-F device and pedicle screw fixation with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) or anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) surgeries. This study used a validated three-dimensional finite element model of the L1-L5 lumbar intact spine. To simulate TLIF surgery, left lateral total facetectomy and partial discectomy were performed at the L3/L4 segment of this intact model. An AVS-TL moon cage (Stryker Orthopaedics) was implanted in the L3/L4 segment and using a Coflex-F device or pedicle screw fixation. To simulate ALIF surgery, partial discectomy and total nuclectomy were performed at the L3/L4 segment of this intact model. A SynCage-Open cage (Synthes Spine, Inc.) was implanted into the L3/L4 segment and combined with a Coflex-F device or pedicle screw fixation. A 400 N follower load and a 10 Nm moment were applied to the intact model to mimic four physiological motions. All four implanted models were subjected to 400 N follower load and specific moments in accordance with the hybrid test method. The results show that the Coflex-F device combined with ALIF surgery can provide stability similar to that of pedicle screw fixation combined with TLIF or ALIF surgery. Also, both the posterior instrumentations (Coflex-F and pedicle screw fixation) combined with TLIF surgery had lower stability than combined with ALIF surgery. © 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.",Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) | Finite element | Interspinous spacer | Pedicle screw fixation | Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF),0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) ', ' Finite element ', ' Interspinous spacer ', ' Pedicle screw fixation ', ' Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF)']",Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) | Finite element | Interspinous spacer | Pedicle screw fixation | Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF),"Lo, C.

The study focused on the design of a Permanent Human mOon Exploration BasE (PHOEBE) located in the Moon South Pole region and its supporting infrastructures. Among all the Moon base building blocks identified and studied, the paper analyzes the impact of a greenhouse, denominated Food And Revitalization Module (FARM), over the feasibility of the human Moon settlement, considering PHOEBE lifetime of 20 years. The objective of the FARM project has been to design a plant growth chamber module to be integrated in a bio-regenerative life support system for PHOEBE and to evaluate the impact of various bio-regenerative system concepts with respect to a typical physico-chemical ECLS system. The design process began with a system analysis, essentially devoted to the study of the required functionalities of the system. A crop analysis has been performed to analyze the plant performances and from these results, different options of diet/crop combinations have been evaluated, starting from a greenhouse able to fulfill almost 100% of all the nutritional needs of the crew, and scaling down to less than 50% of the needs, with food integrations from Earth. The most impacting subsystems have been studied and a possible configuration (both internally and externally) has been designed. The results of the trade-off, based on an Equivalent System Mass approach, showed that after 11 years one greenhouse with cultivation area of 538 m2 and cultivation volume of 222 m3 was adequate for the diet of 18 astronauts on the permanent Moon base, based on 84% of vegetarian food produced on the base and a remaining 16% of food re-supplied from Earth. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The risks suffered from technologies raise concerns about the ethical responsibilities of those who write about the environment. Is it an ethical issue, a matter of crisis management (Cox, 2007)? Without reservation, scholars believe it is normative. A central theme in environmental research is the management of the unknown, matters of uncertainty (Heath, Palenchar, Proutheau, & Hocke, 2007). To this end, it has been concluded, Environmental communication, like risk communication, integrates a focus on the probative force of various facts in the context of symbolic processes that result from the dynamics of a functional or dysfunctional communication infrastructure. (Heath et al., 2007, pp. 45-46) The centerpiece in this potential dysfunction is the lack of a coherent decision heuristic that can be used to balance the advantages sought against the potential harms of industrialization, growth, technology, and policy.

In this research, Lunar Whegs™ is constructed as a proof-of-concept rover that would be able to navigate the surface of the moon, collect a quantity of regolith, and transport it back to a central processing station. The robot incorporates an actuated scoop, specialized feet for locomotion on loose substrates, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) obstacle sensing and avoidance, and sealing and durability features for operation in an abrasive environment. © 2009 IEEE.",,19,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Dunker, Philip A.;Lewinger, William A.;Hunt, Alexander J.;Quinn, Roger D."

A range of schemes have been proposed, including the use of orbiting solar reflectors to reduce solar insolation to compensate for increased radiative forcing of the climate (Early 1989; Angel 2006). While the scale of endeavour required to deploy geo-engineering schemes is impressive, on an even more ambitious scale the same technologies which can be envisaged to engineer the Earth's climate can be scaled to engineer the climate of Mars. Such terraforming schemes (engineering an Earth-like climate) have long been discussed, although the concept became somewhat more mainstream with the work of Sagan and others (Sagan 1961, 1973). Bioengineering schemes have been proposed, including the delivery of customized organisms to convert carbon dioxide to oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars, and darkening the Martian polar caps to reduce their albedo, again using customized organisms. Halocarbons synthesised on Mars have also been considered as a tool to quickly raise the surface temperature and so liberate trapped carbon dioxide (Gerstell et al. 2001; Badescu 2005).

Because the hepatic portal system may not be the optimal site for islet transplantation, several extrahepatic sites have been studied. Here, we examine an intramuscular transplantation site, bioengineered to better support islet neovascularization, engraftment, and survival, and we demonstrate that at this novel site, grafted beta cell mass may be quantitated in a real-time noninvasive manner by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Methods.Streptozotocin-induced rats were pretreated intramuscularly with a biocompatible angiogenic scaffold received syngeneic islet transplants 2 weeks later. The recipients were monitored serially by blood glucose and glucose tolerance measurements and by PET imaging of the transplant site with [11C] dihydrotetrabenazine. Parallel histopathologic evaluation of the grafts was performed using insulin staining and evaluation of microvasularity. Results. Reversal of hyperglycemia by islet transplantation was most successful in recipients pretreated with bioscaffolds containing angiogenic factors when compared with those who received no bioscaffolds or bioscaffolds not treated with angiogenic factors. PET imaging with [11C] dihydrotetrabenazine, insulin staining, and microvascular density patterns were consistent with islet survival, increased levels of angiogenesis, and with reversal of hyperglycemia. Conclusions. Induction of increased neovascularization at an intramuscular site significantly improves islet transplant engraftment and survival compared with controls. The use of a nonhepatic transplant site may avoid intrahepatic complications and permit the use of PET imaging to measure and follow transplanted beta cell mass in real time. These findings have important implications for effective islet implantation outside of the liver and offer promising possibilities for improving islet survival, monitoring, and even prevention of islet loss.

Since that time Canadian capabilities have grown tremendously, placing Canada among the emerging leaders in biological life support systems. The rapid growth of Canadian expertise has been the result of several factors including a large and technically sophisticated greenhouse sector which successfully operates under challenging climatic conditions, well planned technology transfer strategies between the academic and industrial sectors, and a strong emphasis on international research collaborations. Recent activities such as Canada's contribution of the Higher Plant Compartment of the European Space Agency's MELiSSA Pilot Plant and the remote operation of the Arthur Clarke Mars Greenhouse in the Canadian High Arctic continue to demonstrate Canadian capabilities with direct applicability to advanced life support systems. There is also a significant latent potential within Canadian institutions and organizations with respect to directly applicable advanced life support technologies. These directly applicable research interests include such areas as horticultural management strategies (for candidate crops), growth media, food processing, water management, atmosphere management, energy management, waste management, imaging, environment sensors, thermal control, lighting systems, robotics, command and data handling, communications systems, structures, in-situ resource utilization, space analogues and mission operations. With this background and in collaboration with the Canadian aerospace industry sector, a roadmap for future life support contributions is presented here. This roadmap targets an objective of at least 50% food closure by 2050 (providing greater closure in oxygen, water recycling and carbon dioxide uptake). The Canadian advanced life support community has chosen to focus on lunar surface infrastructure and not low Earth orbit or transit systems (i.e. microgravity applications). To advance the technical readiness for the proposed lunar missions, including a lunar plant growth lander, lunar ""salad machine"" (i.e. small scale plant production unit) and a full scale lunar plant production system, a suite of terrestrial developments and analogue systems are proposed. As has been successfully demonstrated by past Canadian advanced life support activities, terrestrial technology transfer and the development of highly qualified personnel will serve as key outputs for Canadian advanced life support system research programs. This approach is designed to serve the Canadian greenhouse industry by developing compliance measures for mitigating environmental impact, reducing labour and energy costs as well as improving Canadian food security, safety and benefit northern/remote communities.

The objectives of these missions include using the Moon as a stepping-stone towards crewed missions to Mars, to test advanced technology, and to further exploration of the Moon for scientific research and in-situ resource utilization. To meet these objectives, it will be necessary to establish and operate a lunar base. As a result, a wide variety of tasks that may pose a number of crew health and safety risks will need to be performed on the surface of the Moon. Therefore, to ensure sustainable human presence on the Moon and beyond, it is essential to anticipate potential risks, assess the impact of each risk, and devise mitigation strategies. To address this, a nine-week intensive investigation was performed by an international, interdisciplinary and intercultural team on how to maximize crew safety on the lunar surface through a symbiotic relationship between astronauts and robots. To identify if and how robotic systems may be employed to enhance safety, it was necessary to establish a standardized risk assessment criteria. Risk assessment criteria used by space agencies and health and safety institutions from around the world were combined and integrated to meet this requirement. In addition, a decision tree was developed to rapidly identify robotic platforms that will enhance crew safety during tasks that require astronaut participation. Using these tools it was possible to appropriately identify the impact of each risk on crew safety in terms of the probability of occurrence (likelihood) and consequence (severity), and generate a list of robotic platforms to improve crew safety. Furthermore, the risk assessment criteria and robotic decision tree are extensible to lunar and Mars exploration missions regardless of mission architecture.

Numerous biological systems and reactor types have been developed and tested for treatment of the generally unique waste streams associated with space exploration. In general, all systems have been designed to reduce organic carbon (OC) and convert organic nitrogen (ON) to nitrate and/or nitrite (NOx-). Some systems have also included removal of the oxidized N in order to reduce overall oxygen consumption and produce additional N2 gas for cabin use. Removal of organic carbon will generally reduce biofouling as well as reduce energy and consumable cost for physiochemical processors.

Disposable clothing is currently used in human space missions. However, the new mission duration, goals, launch penalties and habitat environments may lead to a different conclusion. Mass and volume for disposable clothing are major penalties in long-duration human missions. Equivalent System Mass (ESM) of crew clothing and hygiene towels was estimated at about 11% of total life support system ESM for a 4-crew, 10-year Lunar Outpost mission. Ways to lessen this penalty include: reduce clothing supply mass through using clothes made of advanced fabrics, reduce daily usage rate by extending wear duration and employing a laundry with reusable clothing. Lunar habitat atmosphere pressure and therefore oxygen volume percentage will be different from Space Station or Shuttle. Thus flammability of clothing must be revisited. This paper summarizes recent research efforts in advanced clothing, proposed clothing supply rates, results of a trade-off study between disposable clothing and laundry, and suggestions for Constellation Program clothing.

However, the NASA Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) may have the necessary scope to support the eventual development of a test-bed for the technologies required for space settlement in this region. The polar lunar outpost being considered in the VSE can provide a starting point for developing a lunar surface habitat with a 1-G level of gravity, an Earth-surface level of radiation and a Closed Ecological Life Support System (CELSS). Biosphere II provides an initial estimate of what is required for an eight-person habitat with a CELSS. The VSE outpost includes Lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), which has the potential of being enlarged to provide most of the material needed for the habitat, including the structure of a centrifuge to supply artificial gravity, the shielding for radiation protection and the atmosphere, water and soil for a CELSS. The full development of this lunar habitat will also require the long-term development of an Earth-Moon logistics system that goes beyond the scale currently envisioned in the VSE. In the nearer term, such a lunar habitat and its ISRU/logistics infrastructure can significantly enhance the Moon's utility by extending the time that humans can remain on the Moon and reducing the need for supplies from Earth. In the longer term, the technologies associated with the habitat and its infrastructure can provide the basis for a feasible approach to space settlement.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Purves, Lloyd R."

Primary objectives for these missions include using the Moon as a stepping-stone towards crewed missions to Mars, testing advanced technology, and furthering exploration of the Moon for scientific research and in-situ resource utilization. Meeting these objectives will require a sustained human presence on the lunar surface and the performance of a wide variety of tasks to establish and operate a lunar base. In doing so, ensuring the integrity of the crew's health and safely will be paramount. A nine-week intensive analysis of lunar exploratory robotic tasks for safely (ALERTS) was performed by an international and interdisciplinary team. During this study, the ALERTS team investigated the maximization of crew safely on the lunar surface through the use of a symbiotic relationship between astronauts and robots. By focusing on lunar surface operations necessary for all lunar bases, irrespective of architecture, a list of 66 general tasks were generated and consolidated under ten categories. These tasks were then used as the foundation to identify different risks astronauts will be exposed to. A novel set of risk assessment criteria was developed based on a compromise between risk assessment criteria used by space agencies and health and safely institutions from around the world. Using these criteria, the impact of each risk on crew safely was quantified in terms of the probability of occurrence (likelihood), and consequence (severity). A decision tree was then constructed to rapidly identify the most appropriate robotic platform for tasks that require astronaut involvement, but can be assisted using a robotic system. Finally, the establishment of an International Space Exploration Safely Board (ISESB) is suggested to harmonize safely standards related to human spaceflight at the international level; particularly with regards to the application of robotics for human space exploration.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Hochstein, Jason;Bodkin, David;Chan, Aung;Chasseigne, Romain;Demel, Michael;Doule, Ondrej;Jagula, Dexter;Mulugeta, Lealem;Oprong, Angeline;Quemet, Laure;Turnock, Juan Matthew;Salazar, Pablo"

Actual shock pressures were determined by refractive index measurements and Raman spectroscopy, and shock temperature profiles were calculated.

Part 1 deals with products from Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium, founded in 1923, and Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium, founded in 1925. The two companies were competitors for many years and became two of the world's leading insulin producers. In 1989 they joined forces, merging to become Novo Nordisk A/S, today one of the world's leading biotech companies. The article chronicles the earliest decades of development and progress in insulin production, illustrated with photos of several types of consumer packaging. In 1923 Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium marketed Insulin ""Leo"" tablets, from which patients had to make their own sterile solution for injection two to three times a day, because the solution was unstable. Ready-to-use solutions gradually came on the market, and formulations with prolonged duration, so-called protamin-insulins, were developed in the 1930s. Insulin ""Leo"" Retard was marketed in 1936, and its basic properties were maintained and further developed in step with research breakthroughs well into the 1980s. Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium's first insulin was Insulin Novo in 1925, and at the same time one of the company founders developed Novo-sprøjten (the Novo Syringe) for individual dosage from a special ampoule. The syringe was further developed over the years and was the prototype for the NovoPen launched in 1985 as well as for later advanced dosage systems. Starting in 1938 Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium marketed Zink-Protamin-Insulin Novo and products based on other insulin derivatives in the 1940s. The era concludes with Insulin Novo Lente from 1952 as well as suspensions of amorphous and crystalline zinc-insulin. Ever since, insulin treatments for diabetes have been the focus of intensive development throughout the global marketplace and continue to be so.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Kruse, Edith"

Here, a conceptual design is developed for a Martian agricultural system driven by biologically regenerative functions. One of the core biotechnologies function is the use of hyper-thermophilic aerobic composting bacterial ecology. These thermophilic bacteria can play an important role in increasing the effectiveness of the processing of human metabolic waste and inedible biomass and of converting them to fertilizer for the cultivation of plants. This microbial technology has been already well established for the purpose of processing sewage and waste materials for small local communities in Japan. One of the characteristics of the technology is that the metabolic heat release that occurs during bacterial fermentation raises the processing temperature sufficiently high at 80-100 °C to support hyper-thermophilic bacteria. Such a hyper-thermophilic system is found to have great capability of decomposing wastes including even their normally recalcitrant components, in a reasonably short period of time and of providing a better quality of fertilizer as an end-product. High quality compost has been shown to be a key element in creating a healthy regenerative food production system. In ground-based studies, the soil microbial ecology after the addition of high quality compost was shown to improve plant growth and promote a healthy symbiosis of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Another advantage of such high processing temperature is the ability to sterilize the pathogenic organisms through the fermentation process and thus to secure the hygienic safety of the system. Plant cultivation is one of the other major systems. It should fully utilize solar energy received on the Martian surface for supplying energy for photosynthesis. Subsurface water and atmospheric carbon dioxide mined on Mars should be also used in the plant cultivation system. Oxygen and food production for human thus rely on local Martian resources. A tree growing subsystem will also give an interesting feature to Martian agriculture. In addition to producing excess oxygen, trees' rigid body will provide structural material, which can be used for habitat construction. The combination of hyper-thermophilic aerobic composting, plant cultivation, and tree growing with utilizing in-situ natural local resources available on Mars can provide important elements which can enable space agriculture on Mars. © 2007 COSPAR.",Bacterial ecology | Habitation | Hyper-thermophilic aerobic composting | Mars | Space agriculture,31,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Bacterial ecology ', ' Habitation ', ' Hyper-thermophilic aerobic composting ', ' Mars ', ' Space agriculture']",Bacterial ecology | Habitation | Hyper-thermophilic aerobic composting | Mars | Space agriculture,"Kanazawa, S.;Ishikawa, Y.;Tomita-Yokotani, K.;Hashimoto, H.;Kitaya, Y.;Yamashita, M.;Nagatomo, M.;Oshima, T.;Wada, H."

The main driver for developing MEMS-based components for space is the miniaturization that can be achieved. Miniaturization can not only save orders of magnitude in mass and volume of individual components, but it can also allow increased redundancy, and enable novel spacecraft designs and mission scenarios. However, the commercial breakthrough of MEMS has not occurred within the space business as it has within other branches such as the IT/telecom or automotive industries, or as it has in biotech or life science applications. A main explanation to this is the highly conservative attitude to new technology within the space community. This conservatism is in many senses motivated by a very low risk acceptance in the few and costly space projects that actually ends with a space flight. To overcome this threshold there is a strong need for flight opportunities where reasonable risks can be accepted. Currently there are a few flight opportunities allowing extensive use of new technology in space, but one of the exceptions is the PRISMA program. PRISMA is an international (Sweden, Germany, France, Denmark, Norway, Greece) technology demonstration program with focus on rendezvous and formation flying. It is a two satellite LEO mission with a launch scheduled for the first half of 2009. On PRISMA, a number of novel technologies e.g. RF metrology sensor for Darwin, autonomous formation flying based on GPS and vision-based sensors, ADN-based ""green propulsion"" will be demonstrated in space for the first time. One of the satellites will also have a miniaturized propulsion system onboard based on MEMS-technology. This novel propulsion system includes two microthruster modules, each including four thrusters with micro- to milli-Newton thrust capability. The novelty of this micropropulsion system is that all critical components such as thrust chamber/nozzle assembly including internal heaters, valves and filters are manufactured using MEMS technology. Moreover, miniaturized pressure sensors, relying on MEMS technology, is also part of the system as a self-standing component. The flight opportunity on PRISMA represents one of the few and thus important opportunities to demonstrate MEMS technology in space. The present paper aims at describing this development effort and highlights the benefits of miniaturized components and systems for space using MEMS technology. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Convective heat transfer analysis was performed both theoretically and experimentally for a flat plate.

In order to make bioregenerative ALS systems competitive to physiochemical life-support systems, the 'equivalent system mass' (ESM) must be reduced by as much as possible. One method to reduce the ESM of a bioregenerative ALS system would be to deploy an automated remote sensing system within plant production modules to monitor crop productivity and disease outbreaks. The current study investigated the effects of canopy structure and imaging geometries on the efficiency of measuring the spectral reflectance of individual plants and crop canopies in a simulated ALS system. Results indicate that canopy structure, shading artefacts and imaging geometries are likely to create unique challenges in developing an automated remote sensing system for ALS modules. The cramped quarters within ALS plant growth units will create problems in collecting spectral reflectance measurements from the nadir position (i.e. directly above plant canopies) and, thus, crop canopies likely will be imaged from a diversity of orientations relative to the primary illumination source. In general, highly reflective white or polished surfaces will be used within an ALS plant growth module to maximize the stray light that is reflected onto plant canopies. Initial work suggested that these highly reflective surfaces might interfere with the collection of spectral reflectance measurements of plants, but the use of simple remote sensing algorithms such as 760/685 band ratios or normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images greatly reduced the effects of the reflective backgrounds. A direct comparison of 760/ 685 and NDVI images from canopies of lettuce, pepper and tomato plants indicated that unique models of individual plants are going to be required to properly assess the health conditions of canopies. A mixed model of all three plant species was not effective in predicting plant stress using either the 760/685 or NDVI remote sensing algorithms. © Cambridge University Press 2007.",ALS | Bioregenerative life support systems | CELSS | Remote sensing | Spectral reflectance,2,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['ALS ', ' Bioregenerative life support systems ', ' CELSS ', ' Remote sensing ', ' Spectral reflectance']",ALS | Bioregenerative life support systems | CELSS | Remote sensing | Spectral reflectance,"Schuerger, Andrew C.;Copenhaver, Kenneth L.;Lewis, David;Kincaid, Russell;May, George"

The system recovers water initially contained within wastes and stabilizes the residue with respect to microbial growth. Dry waste may then be safely stored or passed on to the next waste treatment process. Operating under vacuum, microwave power provides the energy necessary for sublimation of ice contained within the waste. This water vapor is subsequently collected as relatively pure ice on a Peltier thermoelectric condenser as it travels en route to the vacuum pump. In addition to stabilization via dehydration, microwave enhanced Freeze Drying reduces the microbial population (∼90%) in the waste. Benefits of microwave power include speed-of-light energy transfer and selective heating of water by direct absorption of electromagnetic radiation, thus minimizing conductive and convective losses, and reducing drying times relative to more conventional Freeze Drying processes. This translates directly into reduced size and power requirements, and lower Equivalent System Mass (ESM).

Colonization experiments with the coccoid cyanobacterium, Chroococcidiopsis sp. and the motile gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, show that, in contrast to initially low porosity crystalline target rocks, which can become more porous as a result of impact bulking, by closing pore spaces the sedimentary cryptoendolithic habitat can be impoverished by impact. However, the heterogeneous distribution of collapsed pores, melt phases, and subsequent recrystallization, results in heterogeneous colonization patterns. Cavities and vesicles formed during melting can yield new habitats for both cryptoendoliths and chasmoendoliths, manifested in the natural cryptoendolithic colonization of shocked sandstones. By contrast, post-impact thermal annealing and recrystallization of impact melt phases destroys the cavities and vesicles. In extreme cases, complete recrystallization of the rock fabric makes the material suitable only for epilithic, and potentially hypolithic, colonists.

Furthermore, introductions of plants to the surface of a partially terraformed Mars will be constrained by the limits of sustainable growth and reproduction of plants to hypobaric conditions. To explore the effects of hypobaria on plant physiology, a low-pressure growth chamber (LPGC) was constructed that maintained hypobaric environments capable of supporting short-term plant physiological studies. Experiments were conducted on Arabidopsis thaliana maintained in the LPGC with total atmospheric pressures set at 101 (Earth sea-level control), 75, 50, 25 or 10 kPa. Plants were grown in a separate incubator at 101 kPa for 6 weeks, transferred to the LPGC, and acclimated to low-pressure atmospheres for either 1 or 16 h. After 1 or 16 h of acclimation, CO2 levels were allowed to drawdown from 0.1 kPa to CO2 compensation points to assess Pnet rates under different hypobaric conditions. Results showed that Pnet increased as the pressures decreased from 101 to 10 kPa when CO2 partial pressure (pp) values were below 0.04 kPa (i.e., when ppCO2 was considered limiting). In contrast, when ppCO2 was in the nonlimiting range from 0.10 to 0.07 kPa, the Pnet rates were insensitive to decreasing pressures. Thus, if CO2 concentrations can be kept elevated in hypobaric plant growth modules or on the surface of a partially terraformed Mars, Pnet rates may be relatively unaffected by hypobaria. Results support the conclusions that (i) hypobaric plant growth modules might be operated around 10 kPa without undue inhibition of photosynthesis and (ii) terraforming efforts on Mars might require a surface pressure of at least 10 kPa (100 mb) for normal growth of deployed plant species. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Advanced life support systems | Hypobaria | Hypoxia | Low-pressure plant growth | Mars | Photorespiration,38,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Advanced life support systems ', ' Hypobaria ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Low-pressure plant growth ', ' Mars ', ' Photorespiration']",Advanced life support systems | Hypobaria | Hypoxia | Low-pressure plant growth | Mars | Photorespiration,"Richards, Jeffrey T.;Corey, Kenneth A.;Paul, Anna Lisa;Ferl, Robert J.;Wheeler, Raymond M.;Schuerger, Andrew C."

Comets are still largely regarded as frigid, pristine bodies of protosolar nebula material that are devoid of liquid water and therefore unsuitable for life. Complex organic compounds have been observed in comets and on the water-rich asteroid 1998 KY26 and near IR observations have indicated the presence of crystalline water ice and ammonia hydrate on the large Kuiper Belt object (50000) Quaoar that has resurfacing suggesting cryovolcanic outgassing. Spacecraft observations of the chemical compositions and characteristics of the nuclei of several comets (Halley, Borrelly, Wild 2, and Tempel l) have shown that comets contain complex organic chemicals; that water is the predominant volatile; and that extremely high temperatures (∼350-400 K) can be reached on the surface of the very black (albedo∼0.03) nuclei of comets when they approach the Sun. Impact craters and pinnacles observed on comet Wild 2 suggest a thick crust. Episodic outbursts and jets from the nuclei of several comets indicate that localized regimes of liquid water and water vapor can periodically exist beneath the comet crust. The Deep Impact mission found the temperature of the nucleus of comet Tempel 1 at 1.5 AU varied from a minimum of 280 ±8 K the 330K (57°C) on the sunlit side. In this paper it is argued that that pools and films of liquid water exist (within a wide range of temperatures) in cavities and voids just beneath the hot, black crust. The possibility of liquid water existing over a wide range of temperatures significantly enhances the possibility that comets might contain niches suitable for the growth of microbial communities and ecosystems. These regimes would be ideal for the growth of psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic photoautotrophs and chemolithotrophs such as the motile filamentous cyanobacteria (e.g., Calothrix, Oscillatoria, Phormidium, and Spirulina) that grow in geothermal springs and geysers of Earth at temperatures ranging from 320K to 345K and are also found growing in cold polar desert soils. The mineralized remains of morphorypes of all of these cyanobacteria have also been found in the Orgueil Cil and the Murchison CN2 carbonaceous meteorites that may derive from cometary parent bodies.

Growth of food, in turn, necessitates a food processing element. A multipurpose fruit and vegetable processor (MFVP) was designed and built for this purpose by comparing potential technologies using equivalent system mass (ESM) impact, a NASA metric. As an example of selection and evaluation, the concentration sub-unit to produce tomato concentrate is reviewed. Evaporation, and integrated membrane approaches-microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO)-were compared for applicability. Direct RO was selected and tests evaluated operating conditions, maximum concentration and flux decline. Filtration performance parameters were obtained: permeate flux, volume concentration factor (VCF) and power usage. Pressure and temperature were the determining factors in performance and a maximum concentrate of 22.7 °Brix was projected. Increases in cross-flow velocity (CFV) added power demand and therefore was found to raise ESM. Added transmembrane pressure (TMP), on the other hand was found to offset power increases by reducing processing time. The study validated the use of ESM as a tool for selecting technologies and proved the usability of RO for the MFVP process. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Bioregenerative life support systems will utilize higher plants to regenerate oxygen, water, and edible biomass for crews, and are likely to significantly lower the 'equivalent system mass' of crewed vehicles. As part of an ongoing effort to begin the development of an automatic remote sensing system to monitor plant health in bioregenerative life support modules, we tested the efficacy of seven artificial illumination sources on the remote detection of plant stresses. A cohort of pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L.) were grown 42 days at 25 °C, 70% relative humidity, and 300 μmol m-2 s-1 of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; from 400 to 700 nm). Plants were grown under nutritional stresses induced by irrigating subsets of the plants with 100, 50, 25, or 10% of a standard nutrient solution. Reflectance spectra of the healthy and stressed plants were collected under seven artificial lamps including two tungsten halogen lamps, plus high pressure sodium, metal halide, fluorescent, microwave, and red/blue light emitting diode (LED) sources. Results indicated that several common algorithms used to estimate biomass and leaf chlorophyll content were effective in predicting plant stress under all seven illumination sources. However, the two types of tungsten halogen lamps and the microwave illumination source yielded linear models with the highest residuals and thus the highest predictive capabilities of all lamps tested. The illumination sources with the least predictive capabilities were the red/blue LEDs and fluorescent lamps. Although the red/blue LEDs yielded the lowest residuals for linear models derived from the remote sensing data, the LED arrays used in these experiments were optimized for plant productivity and not the collection of remote sensing data. Thus, we propose that if adjusted to optimize the collection of remote sensing information from plants, LEDs remain the best candidates for illumination sources for monitoring plant stresses in bioregenerative life support systems. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.",ALS | Bioregenerative life support system | CELSS | Plant stress | Remote sensing,7,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['ALS ', ' Bioregenerative life support system ', ' CELSS ', ' Plant stress ', ' Remote sensing']",ALS | Bioregenerative life support system | CELSS | Plant stress | Remote sensing,"Schuerger, Andrew C.;Richards, Jeffrey T."

In actuality, even the most advanced anticipated human life support systems will use physical/ chemical systems to recycle water and oxygen and will depend on food from Earth. This paper compares bioregenerative and physical/chemical life support systems using Equivalent System Mass (ESM), which gauges the relative cost of hardware based on its mass, volume, power, and cooling requirements. Bioregenerative systems are more feasible for longer missions, since they avoid the cost of continually supplying food. However, computations of the required ESM show that the much higher initial cost of biological/ecological human life support makes it much more expensive than physical/chemical life support even for multi-year missions. The least expensive life support for brief human missions uses direct provision of all food, water and oxygen from Earth without any recycling. The familiar breakeven and ESM ratio analysis repeated here confirms these well-known and widely accepted results.

The system recovers water initially contained within wastes and stabilizes the residue with respect to microbial growth. Dry waste may then be safely stored or passed on to the next waste treatment process. Using microwave power, water present in the solid waste is selectively and rapidly heated. Liquid phase water flashes to steam and superheats. Hot water and steam formed in the interior of waste particles create an environment that is lethal to bacteria, yeasts, molds, and viruses. Steam contacts exposed surfaces and provides an effective thermal kill of microbes, in a manner similar to that of an autoclave. Volatilized water vapor is recovered by condensation. Benefits of microwave power include rapid heat-up and cool-down, and selective heating of water by the direct absorption of electromagnetic radiation, thus minimizing conductive and convective losses, and reducing drying times. This translates directly into reduced size and power requirements, and lower Equivalent System Mass (ESM). Stabilization with respect to microbial growth has been demonstrated using a variety of challenge contaminants, including: bacteria, fungi and a virus. Water recoveries greater than 90% have also been achieved.

Ultimately, efficient organics removal followed by novel nitrogen removal processes will be advantageous compared to conventional fully-aerobic or anoxic-aerobic treatment systems. To date, the majority of research investigating the treatability of Early Planetary Base (EPB) ersatz wastewater formulations has involved the use of aerobic and anoxic treatment processes. However, little work has been published on studies done under strictly anaerobic conditions. In this work, a laboratory-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was fed EPB ersatz for 110 days. Initially, the reactor exhibited instability and biomass washout, with chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 22.7% ± 9.3%. After reseeding with new biomass, providing a supplementation phase, and increasing the SBR cycle duration from 6 hours to 12 hours, COD removal improved to 48.9% ± 10.8%. This performance was statistically different from the previous phase (P=0.004), demonstrating that longer cycle times favored increased organic removal. The supplementation period, during which the biomass was able to adapt to soap-based wastewater, resulted in more stable operation and prevented immediate biomass washout. Ammonia increased in the reactor effluent, due to conversion of organic nitrogen to ammonia. While COD removal performance was lower than expected, results suggest that anaerobic pretreatment is viable for increasing the nitrogen to organic carbon ratio of the wastewater, an important consideration for potential downstream nitrogen removal processes.

With current waste models, 1300 kg of waste occupying a volume 20 m3 will be generated in a 180-day mission to Mars. Unprocessed waste poses a biological hazard to crew health and morale. The waste processing methods currently under consideration include incineration, microbial oxidation, pyrolysis and compaction. Although each has advantages, no single method has yet been developed that is safe, recovers valuable resources including oxygen and water, and has low energy and space requirements. Thus, the objective of this project was to develop a low temperature oxidation process to convert waste cleanly and rapidly to carbon dioxide and water. In this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project, TDA Research Inc. (TDA) conducted tests to measure the rates of oxidation using ozone with five model waste components. We used wheat straw to represent food scraps, cellulose to represent waste paper, methionine to represent feces, urea for other biological waste, and high density polyethylene (HDPE) for plastic and plastic wrapping. We measured the oxidation rates of individual waste components and also a mixture of all five. At temperatures less than or equal to 200°C, we obtained a maximum waste oxidation rate of 68 grams per hour per liter of reactor volume with high selectivity for carbon dioxide and water. In addition we obtained very low concentrations of NOX. In all cases, we found that less than 1% of the nitrogen in the waste compounds was converted to NOX. Finally, we found that the highest oxidation rates obtained in this project approach those rates needed to design a reasonably sized system for use onboard spacecraft and the estimated equivalent system mass (ESM) for this method of waste control is similar to values estimated for other, less efficient methods.

Simulations allow for the testing of different system configurations before hardware is built. This is useful when malfunctions are reliably expected, costs are high, or when the integrated systems are unavailable. Thus, it is important that such simulations are transient and integrate all major subsystems and activities. This paper describes a habitat model that is transient, discrete, stochastic, and nonstationary. It models most of the components of a life-support system including the crew, crops, water and air recovery systems, extravehicular activities, and power. Because the model accepts nonstationary input, it can be used to test habitat configurations and components before building an actual habitat Malfunctions can be injected at any time. A genetic algorithm is used here to find an optimal habitat configuration for a 90-day mission to the moon. Approximately 20,000 system configurations were considered in a series of experiments considering several lunar scenarios. It has been shown that a tuned genetic algorithm is capable of preliminary sizing of several life-support components.

Specifically, the authors focused on the integration and application of advanced technologies in fields like genetic engineering, biotechnology, robotics, and terraforming, before the end of the current century. Shortterm, economically feasible terraforming methods to change Mars into a more 'Earthlike' environment were described. Following this, current methods of actively adapting life to fit these new Earthlike conditions were developed into original and innovative solutions for living on Mars. The purpose of the project was to look at ways of reducing the time spans and complexity involved in a complete terraforming of Mars, and to ultimately define a way of creating a techno-ecosphere on Mars while the planet is only partially terraformed.

The fact that geochemical evidence for life may extend back to the earliest portion of the terrestrial rock record (approx. 4.0 Ga) makes it impossible to state with any certainty whether life originated on Earth or if it was introduced to Earth. Similarly, since a living system has never been synthesized in the laboratory, the requisite conditions and subsequent pathways for that origin remain unknown. It is this lack of definitive information that continues to inspire us to search outside the Earth for clues to life's origins. However, our ability to determine if life as we know it presently exists or existed elsewhere in our solar system or beyond depends on the establishment of criteria that can be used to determine its existence and to distinguish it from present-day life on Earth. The latter is critical, as it is extremely difficult to completely avoid contamination during sample collection and analysis. This is especially true with respect to materials returned to Earth, as is planned for future Mars' missions. Given their ubiquity and unique stable isotope compositions resulting from fractionations associated with their respective abiotic and biotic syntheses, amino acids are one of the classes of compounds best suited for establishing the existence of life as we know it.

Using the Atacama Desert as a test site for the current dry conditions on Mars, we characterized the chemical reactivity of surface and near-surface atmosphere in the dry core of the Atacama. MOI is a chemiresistor-based sensor array that measures the reaction rates of chemical films that are sensitive to particular types of oxidants or that mimic chemical characteristics of pre-biotic and biotic materials. With these sensors, the chemical reactivity of a planetary environment is characterized by monitoring the resistance of the film as a function of time. Our instrumental approach correlates reaction rates with dust abundance, UV flux, humidity, and temperature, allowing discrimination between competing hypotheses of oxidant formation and organic decomposition. The sensor responses in the Atacama are consistent with an oxidative attack by strong acids triggered by dust accumulation, followed by transient wetting due to an increase in relative humidity during the night. We conclude that in the Atacama Desert, and perhaps on Mars, low pH resulting from acid accumulation, combined with limited water availability and high oxidation potential, can result in oxidizing acid reactions on dust and soil surfaces during low-moisture transient wetting events (i.e. thin films of water). These soil acids are expected to play a significant role in the oxidizing nature of the soils, the formation of mineral surface coatings, and the chemical modification of organics in the surface material. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Acid deposition | Atacama Desert | Mars instrument | Oxidant,43,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,"['Acid deposition ', ' Atacama Desert ', ' Mars instrument ', ' Oxidant']",Acid deposition | Atacama Desert | Mars instrument | Oxidant,"Quinn, R.

Use of EWRF in solid waste processing is advantageous in that an edible product, the mushroom, is produced that adds variety to the restrictive diet of the astronaut during extended crewed missions. To optimize the efficiency of EWRF, key parameters (strains, N source, cropping pattern, growth medium/substrate amendment) controlling the biological process were examined under laboratory conditions. Various strains of Lentinula edodes and Grifola frondosa were evaluated in artificial culture media amended with human biosolid or food waste. Mycelial growth in strains of Pleurotus ostreatus and Lentinula edodes were measured on single and paired crop substrates. Enhancement of fungal growth by enriching the medium with KNO 3, NH4Cl and urea and incorporation of solid thermophilic aerobic reactor (STAR) sludge in rice straw, as nitrogen sources, was determined. Significant growth differences were observed between G. frondosa strains in media added with either KNO3 or NH4Cl sources of nitrogen. P. ostreatus 'Grey Dover' was most prolific in growth and mushroom production in various crop residues. The use of EWRF may be a cost effective way to accomplish solid waste processing in an ALS system that requires low cost technologies applicable to the reduction of Equivalent System Mass (ESM), a major requisite for long-term space exploration or habitation.

This design must ensure microbial inactivation efficacy, as well as minimize volume, mass, power and maintenance requirements. The means to achieve this design goal is a numerical modeling tool developed in this research, which is based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), UV radiation intensity field models and microbial inactivation kinetics. The inputs to this numerical model are the desired reactor size and geometry, the inlet velocity and boundary conditions, the UV lamp output power and radiation intensity profile, as well as the characteristics of the aqueous media. The outputs of the model are the UV dose distribution delivered to the microorganisms traversing the reactor and the degree of microbial inactivation achieved. Based on these outputs, the performance of the UV reactor can be assessed for the entire range of practical operating conditions. The validity of the numerical model was assessed with biodosimetry experiments employing Bacillus subtilis spores as the target microorganism and a commercially available UV disinfection reactor. The numerical model is used to investigate alternative UV reactor geometries which can be incorporated into an Advanced Life Support (ALS) water purification system for long-term space missions. The simulation input flow rate is based on the daily water output from six crewmembers and the biomass production chamber, which is included in the ALS closed-loop water system.

The rationale for biological processing lies in the removal of organic and nitrogen contaminants within the wastewater, leading to concomitant reductions in the costs of downstream P/C systems used for production of potable water. Several different general approaches for biological processing are under evaluation; 1) separate versus single reactors for conducting nitrification and denitrification, 2) rotating the membrane unit to enhance the rate of nitrification, 3) integration of alternative electron acceptors (H2 or CH4) for more complete volatilization of nitrogen. Equivalent system mass (ESM analysis) of the different biological reactor configurations was performed to assess design alternatives for both the transit mission and early planetary base (EPB). Consolidating nitrification and denitrification into a single reactor or rotating the membrane units decreased ESM costs by 4-10% depending on the mission scenario. Adding a reactor to provide H2 and enhanced denitrification led to the largest increases in ESM (13-20% in transit, 7-9% for the EPB). The majority of the costs associated with the biological processing (~70%) was associated with pumps and manpower. Preliminary evaluation of the effects of bioreactor effluent on downstream processing systems indicates that optimizing the extent of primary NH4+ conversion (i.e., ammonia oxidation) is of primary importance in biological reactor design. Better data on the impacts of residual organics and non-volatile N (i.e., NO3-, NO2-) on biofouling of physicochemical systems is needed before the treatment standards for these effluent components can be established. This work serves as a basis for further ESM analysis of biological processing approaches using further refinements in assumptions, additional test data, and alternative reactor designs.

Thus, in order to provide sufficient food for space missions exceeding one year, it is necessary to implement a plant breeding system on board, which can at least partly cover the crew's nutritional needs. In the frame of a European Space Agency (ESA) feasibility study on Closed Loop Food Systems (CLFS) for Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Transit to Mars and Mars Surface scenarios, a nutrition selection algorithm was developed to define well equilibrated and diverse menus able to meet dietary requirements. First, an extensive, diversified crop list was compiled from a broad range of literature sources. Secondly, a database was constructed, containing all gathered information for the selected crops. In the scope of this ESA project, follow-up studies on plant growth chamber design and Equivalent System Mass (ESM) analysis were carried out. Based on supplying a fixed percentage of the crew's energy requirement, different scenarios were worked out leading to a set of suitable menus using four crops. Crop performance ranking was controlled by assigning weighing factors to key parameters. The menu composition was further fine-tuned to the dietary needs by varying the relative amounts of the selected crops. Using this approach, nutritional value was optimized. The crop selection procedure was developed based on a fixed energy input, but has the flexibility to calculate menu compositions using alternative selection criteria, such as minimization of waste, optimization of breeding surface, and fulfillment of specific nutritional needs. Finally, a trade-off is made considering the optimal culture conditions for each crop represented in the engineered menu. This approach guarantees efficient food-production while minimizing the volume of the food producing unit.

In addition to producing edible biomass by growing vegetable species, these systems can be used in closed loop configuration with bio-regenerative life support subsystems for water and CO2 recycling and O2 production. Aiming at this objective, the European Space Agency (ESA) undertook a feasibility study on Closed Loop Food Systems (CLFS) for Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Transit to Mars and Mars Surface scenarios. This paper describes the study's results. Firstly, candidate crops are selected based on nutritional characteristics and aspects like yield, cultivation surface and volume, and generated inedible biomass. A culture plan for these crops is then established. The design process of a Food Production Unit (FPU) begins with the definition of an On Ground Experimental Growth Unit (OGEGU), a ground reference system that is later adapted to the proposed Space scenarios. For Low Earth Orbit (LEO), two secondary structures options (racks and spiral), fitting a Columbus-sized module, are presented and their food production capabilities are analyzed. Similarly, design options for Transit to Mars and Mars Surface are described. Mass, power and volume budgets are determined and the Equivalent System Mass (ESM) methodology is used for trade-off study. For the LEO options process modeling and preliminary mechanical, thermal, safety and logistics analysis are done. Impacts on the International Space Station (ISS) due to potential FPU implementation are also studied. For the Mars surface scenario, an adapted FPU architecture is presented. Interface issues between FPU and bio-regenerative life support systems are also addressed. The study shows that FPU systems for LEO application could deliver ca. 12% of the food requirements, which makes them a very interesting platform for both space agriculture research and complementing nutritional requirements. For the Mars Surface application provision of up to 40 % food requirements is shown possible. Finally, relevant technological gaps identified throughout the study are outlined.

The ESM of a naturally lit plant growth system compares favorably to an electrically lit system when corrections for area are made based on available light levels. A transparent structure should be more efficient at collecting insolation than collectors due to the diffusivity of the Mars atmosphere and inherent transmission losses encountered with fiber optics. The need to provide a pressurized environment for the plants indicates the use of an inflatable structure.

The main disadvantages of pyrolysis processing are: (1) the product stream is more complex than for many of the alternative treatments; (2) the product gases cannot be vented directly into the cabin without further treatment because of the high CO concentrations. One possible solution is to combine a pyrolysis step with catalytic oxidation (combustion) of the effluent gases. This integration takes advantage of the best features of each process, which is insensitivity to product mix, no O2 consumption, and batch processing, in the case of pyrolysis, and simplicity of the product effluent stream in the case of oxidation. In addition, this hybrid process has the potential to result in a significant reduction in Equivalent System Mass (ESM) and system complexity. This paper describes the development of a prototype hybrid pyrolysis/oxidation system which can process up to 100 grams of material. The prototype includes a multi-stage reactor and product collection, process monitoring and process control systems.

We plan to make the container reusable, so that after food consumption, the package is reused to contain and sterilize waste. This approach will reduce Equivalent System Mass (ESM) by using a compact heating technology, and reducing mass requirements for waste storage. Preliminary tests of the package within a specially-designed ohmic heating enclosure show that ISS menu item could easily be heated using ohmic heating technology.

Photocatalysis represents a promising solution for part of a system designed for recovery of water from humidity condensate, urine, and shower waste. It eliminates the need for chemical oxidants that are dangerous and difficult to transport, and the considerable energy consumption of distillation. In terms of decreasing the equivalent system mass (ESM) with respect to these alternative technologies, considerations for the volume, mass, cooling and crew time are also important. This photocatalytic reactor generates the oxidant in the form of hydroxyl radicals and valence band holes by exposing silica-titania composite particles with a barium ferrite core to ultraviolet light. The magnetic core of the catalyst allows for separation, confinement, and agitation. This agitation, accomplished with a sinusoidal signal fed solenoid, allows greater mass transfer and improves mineralization of organics. In addition, fixed magnets strategically placed above the reactor confines the catalyst to where it receives maximum UV exposure. The composite catalyst, irradiated by an 8-watt 254 nm lamp, was able to decrease the 10 mg/L initial phenol concentration by an average of 92.2% after one hour. Although the frequency of the signal fed to the solenoid did not appear to have an impact on the extent of photodegradation (10-80 Hz), there was a strong correlation with the ball milling process. Building upon pioneering work of Mazyck and Drwiega (04-ICES 2404), this promising option for water recovery has been optimized with improvements in magnetic field, reactor design, and catalyst synthesis.

The scenarios investigated include full supply of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water from Earth without regenerative technologies, constant re-supply and removal rates from regenerative technologies, and variable re-supply and removal rates from crops. Hourly crewmember schedule is implemented to determine its effect on the storage cost. No specific regenerative technologies are assumed, hence giving the freedom to minimize the storage tank size without technical constraints. Equivalent system mass (ESM) analysis on storage tanks is conducted to investigate the storage cost in all scenarios. ESM is a cost metric used to perform trade study analysis. The components considered in ESM are mass, volume, power, cooling and crew time. In this paper, a 15-year Mars surface mission is selected. Results indicate that crewmember schedule affects the storage tank capacity significantly when the re-supply/removal rate is constant. Crop effect is greater than crewmember schedule when it is introduced into the model. It becomes the driving force on the storage cost. However, when contingency, leakage and technology inefficiency levels are considered, the leakage and technology inefficiency rates of more than 1% have a larger impact on the storage ESM than crops do.

More advanced analyses rely on extracting hydrocarbons from oil fluid inclusions, which allows the integration of geochemical data with petrography, especially where individual inclusions can be analysed. Data from distinct populations of inclusions can highlight changes in geochemistry with time from a single sample. The extraction of organic molecules from aqueous inclusion fluids will be much more difficult technically but, if achieved, could help to obtain biomolecular data from early Earth samples and from samples retrieved from other planets.

The evaluation was based mainly on the terrestrial testbed projects MELISSA (ESA) and BIOS (Russia). In addition, some methods suggested by the Advanced Life Support Project (NASA) were considered. Computer models, including mass flows were established for each of the systems with the goal of closing system loops to the extent possible. In order to cope with the differences in the supported crew size and provided nutrition, all systems were scaled for supporting a crew of six for a 780 day Mars mission (180 days transport to Mars; 600 days surface period) as given in the NASA Design Reference Mission Scenario [Hoffman, S.J., Kaplan, D.L. Human exploration of Mars: the Reference Mission of the NASA Mars Exploratory Study, 1997]. All models were scaled to provide the same daily allowances, as of calories, to the crew. Equivalent System Mass (ESM) analysis was used to compare the investigated system models against each other. Following the comparison of the terrestrial systems, the system specific subsystem options for Food Supply, Solid Waste Processing, Water Management and Atmosphere Revitalization were evaluated in a separate trade study. The best subsystem technologies from the trade study were integrated into an overall design solution based on mass flow relationships. The optimized LSS is mainly a bioregenerative system, complemented by a few physico-chemical elements, with a total ESM of 18,088 kg, which is about 4 times higher than that of a pure physico-chemical LSS, as designed in an earlier study. © 2005 COSPAR.

It presents an analysis of current life support system technologies and a preliminary design of an integrated system for supporting humans during transit to and on the surface of the planet Mars. This effort was based on the NASA Design Reference Mission (DRM) for the human exploration of Mars [NASA Design Reference Mission (DRM) for Mars, Addendum 3.0, from the world wide web:http://exploration.jsc.nasa.gov/marsref/contents.html.]. The integrated design was broken into four subsystems: Water Management, Atmosphere Management, Waste Processing, and Food Supply. The process started with the derivation of top-level requirements from the DRM. Additional system and subsystem level assumptions were added where clarification was needed. Candidate technologies were identified and characterized based on performance factors. Trade studies were then conducted for each subsystem. The resulting technologies were integrated into an overall design solution using mass flow relationships. The system level trade study yielded two different configurations - one for the transit to Mars and another for the surface habitat, which included in situ resource utilization. Equivalent System Mass analyses were used to compare each design against an open-loop (non-regenerable) baseline system. © 2003 International Astronatical Federation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While the exact supply scenario has yet to be determined, some type of post-processing of these grains must occur if they are shipped as bulk ingredients or grown on site for use in foods. Understanding the requirements for processing grains in space is essential for incorporating the process into the ALS food system. The ESM metric developed by NASA describes and compares individual system impact on a closed system in terms of a single parameter, mass. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of grain mill type on the ESM of producing yeast and flat breads. Hard red spring wheat berries were ground using a Brabender Quadrumat Jr. or the Kitchen-Aid grain mill attachment (both are proposed post-harvest technologies for the ALS system) to produce white and whole wheat flour, respectively. Yeast bread was made using three methods (hand+oven, bread machine, mixer with dough hook attachment + oven). Flat bread was made using four methods (hand+oven, hand+griddle, mixer+oven, mixer+griddle). Data on all inputs (active time, passive time, mass and volume of ingredients and equipment, power) were measured and used to calculate ESM. Assumptions were based on data in NASA documents. Data were analyzed using PC-SAS with significance at P < 0.05. Grain mill type significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the ESM of making both bread types; and the Brabender Quadrumat Jr. contributed significantly (P < 0.05) more mass than the Kitchen-Aid grain mill to the ESM for producing both types of bread.

Through good design including use of modern fabrics, a lighter weight wardrobe is expected to be feasible. Collateral benefits should include greater user comfort and reduced lint generation. A wide variety of approaches to cleaning is possible. The initial evaluation was made based on a terrestrial water-based washer and dryer system, as this represents the greatest experience base.

This ALS system must include a food processing subsystem capable of producing a variety of nutritious, acceptable, and safe edible ingredients and food products from pre-packaged and re-supply foods as well as salad crops grown on the transit vehicle or other crops grown on planetary surfaces. However, designing, building, developing, and maintaining such a subsystem is bound to many constraints and restrictions. The limited power supply, storage locations, variety of crops, crew time, need to minimize waste, and other ESM parameters influence the selection of processing equipment and techniques. Several researchers have calculated ESM of select types of food processing equipment to compare ESM for individual food types; however, a complete survey of ESM parameters for currently available food processing unit operations has not been completed. In order to direct NASA's research and technology efforts related to the food subsystem, the technologies available on Earth for food processing, preservation, and packaging must be identified and the viability of these technologies must be assessed. Minimizing mass, volume, and energy consumption are important factors to be considered when locating available food processing equipment and evaluating feasibility for use in an ALS system. Once the ESM has been estimated for available equipment, modifications can be suggested to improve efficiency and reduce ESM. The objective of this study was to compile ESM-parameter information (mass, volume, and power) for currently available, small-scale food processing equipment and to provide average, high, and low ESM values for each class of equipment (hand-held and bench-top mixers, etc.) that performs the following unit operations: mixing, size reduction, heat transfer (heating and cooling), and extraction (water, oil, and juice). In this study, each piece of equipment was assumed to perform a single task, the power required for cooling was set equivalent to the power needed to operate the equipment, and the crew-time was not considered in the preliminary ESM estimates.

Using Equivalent System Mass (ESM) and a Modified Food Quality Index (MFQI), the Food Metric Value (FMV) may provide researchers a way to incorporate quantitative as well as qualitative attributes into a metric more suitable for evaluating potential candidate crops. An FMV was calculated using different tofu production rates and product palatability values for the Hoyt or Vinton 81 cultivar. Results indicate that while crop growth efficiency favors use of the Hoyt cultivar, resulting food yield and product attributes favor use of Vinton 81.

Biotechnology is keeping pace with these scientific advances. Current therapies target the various elements of the inflammatory cascade implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of the pharmacologic therapies used in IBD vary from actions that are extremely broad to those that are cellular or cytokine specific. Despite the various therapeutic options available for IBD patients, chosen therapies should be based on the overall treatment goal for individual patients. Therapeutics can be broadly categorized as induction therapies (goal to treat active disease) and maintenance therapies (goal to prevent relapse of disease). The modern thinking behind drug development is that IBD therapy should be disease modifying so to avoid complications and alter the long term natural history of disease. This review will cover both current and emerging agents and highlight the pathogenesis of IBD and how it relates to therapeutic targets.

Evaluation of requirements satisfaction can be difficult, particularly at an early stage of mission design. Because launch cost is a critical factor and relatively easy to quantify, it is a point of focus in early mission design. The method used to determine launch cost influences the accuracy of the estimate. This paper discusses the appropriateness of dynamic mission simulation in estimating the launch cost of a life support system.

Emission spectroscopy indicated that D. radiodurans cells were volatilized into CO2, CO, N2, and H2O, confirming that these plasmas were removing complex biological matter from surfaces.

Robots provide complementary skills in being able to work in extremely risky environments, but their ability to perceive, think, and act by themselves is currently not error-free, although these capabilities are continually improving with the emergence of new technologies. Substantial past experience validates these generally qualitative notions.

Other criteria such as performance, safety, reliability, crew time, and technical and schedule risk are considered, but cost is always an important factor. Because launch cost would account for much of the cost of a future planetary mission, and because launch cost is directly proportional to the mass launched, equivalent mass has been used instead of cost to select advanced life support technology. The equivalent mass of a life support system includes the estimated mass of the hardware and of the spacecraft pressurized volume, power supply, and cooling system that the hardware requires. The equivalent mass of a system is defined as the total payload launch mass needed to provide and support the system. An extension of equivalent mass, Equivalent System Mass (ESM), has been established for use in the Advanced Life Support project. ESM adds a mass-equivalent of crew time and possibly other cost factors to equivalent mass. Traditional equivalent mass is strictly based on flown mass and reflects only the launch cost. ESM includes other important cost factors, but it complicates the simple ""flown mass"" definition of equivalent mass by adding a non-physical mass penalty for crew time that may exceed the actual flown mass. Equivalent mass is used only in life support analysis. Life Cycle Cost (LCC) is much more commonly used. LCC includes DDT&E, launch, and operations costs. For Earth orbit rather than planetary missions, the launch cost is less than the cost of Design, Development, Test, and Evaluation (DDT&E). LCC is a more inclusive cost estimator than equivalent mass. The relative costs of development, launch, and operations vary depending on the mission destination and duration. Since DDT&E or operations may cost more than launch, LCC gives a more accurate relative cost ranking than equivalent mass. To select the lowest cost technology for a particular application we should use LCC rather than equivalent mass.",,13,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Jones, Harry"

However it is very difficult for a designer to perform a valid evaluation using multiple criteria and selecting from multiple technologies.

The conversion coefficients that represent power, volume, crew time, etc. in equivalent mass units are rather subjective and questionable. The purpose of this paper is to show that there is a less subjective technique available that uses decision-making support systems to allow a designer to make a valid decision about future system using a set of multiple criteria, representing system costs and benefits both quantitative and qualitative. This technique will account for uncertainty in information based on system technical readiness level. Different risk level scenarios will also be considered, where the designer would be able to evaluate future system based on the approach he/she is willing to take.

Mass is used as a cost measure because the mass of an object determines propulsion (acceleration) cost (i.e. amount of fuel needed), and costs relating to propulsion dominate mission cost. Mission location drives mission cost because acceleration is typically required to initiate and complete a change in location. Total mission costs may be reduced by minimizing the mass of materials that must be propelled to each distinct location. In order to minimize fuel requirements for missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO), the hardware and astronauts may not all go to the same location. For example, on a Lunar or Mars mission, some of the hardware or astronauts may stay in orbit while the rest of the hardware and astronauts descend to the planetary surface. In addition, there may be disposal of waste or used hardware at various mission locations to avoid propulsion of mass that is no longer needed in the mission. This paper demonstrates how using location factors in the calculation of ESM can account for the effects of various acceleration events and can improve the accuracy and value of the ESM metric to mission planners. Even a mission with one location can benefit from location factor analysis if the alternative technologies under consideration consume resources at different rates. For example, a mission that regenerates resources will have a relatively constant mass compared to one that uses consumables and vents/discards mass along the way. This paper shows examples of how location factors can affect ESM calculations and how the inclusion of location factors can change the relative value of technologies being considered for development.",,3,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Fisher, John W.;Levri, Julie A.;Jones, Harry W."

Flat breads were made using four methods (hand & oven, hand & griddle, mixer with dough hook attachment & oven, mixer with dough hook attachment & griddle). Two formulations were used for each bread system (scratch ingredients, commercial mix). ESM was calculated for each of these scenarios. The objective of this study was to compare the ESM of yeast and flat bread production for a Martian surface outpost. Method (equipment) for both types of bread production was demonstrated to be the most significant influence of ESM when one equipment use was assumed. When multi-functional equipment was assumed, type of bread and formulation began influencing ESM calculations to a great extent.

Equivalent System Mass (ESM) is often applied to evaluate trade study options in the Advanced Life Support (ALS) Program. ESM can be used to identify which of several options that meet all requirements are most likely to have lowest cost. It can also be used to identify which of the many interacting parts of a life support system have the greatest impact and sensitivity to assumptions. This paper summarizes recommendations made in the newly developed ALS ESM Guidelines Document and expands on some of the issues relating to trade studies that involve ESM. In particular, the following three points are expounded: 1)The importance of objectives: Analysis objectives drive the approach to any trade study, including identification of assumptions, selection of characteristics to compare in the analysis, and the most appropriate techniques for reflecting those characteristics. 2)The importance of results interpretation: The accuracy desired in the results depends upon the analysis objectives, whereas the realized accuracy is determined by the data quality and degree of detail in analysis methods. 3)The importance of analysis documentation: Documentation of assumptions and data modifications is critical for effective peer evaluation of any trade study. ESM results are analysis-specific and should always be reported in context, rather than as solitary values. For this reason, results reporting should be done with adequate rigor to allow for verification by other researchers.",,0,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Levri, Julie A.;Drysdale, Alan E."

This water treatment method allows for a compact reactor design (i.e., reduced Equivalent Systems Mass (ESM)) that is applicable in future NASA missions that will require water recovery. The reactor would provide a post-processing unit to remove any organic contaminants (e.g., VOCs) not removed in prior water subsystems. Several approaches to the reactor design are being explored. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the chosen photocatalyst based on its proven performance and non-toxicity. Because of their propensity to adsorb pollutants, silica and activated carbon are being investigated as supporting materials for the titania. Three types of particles are being tested for their ability to destroy organic contaminants: silica gel doped with titania, activated carbon coated with titania, and silica gel doped with both activated carbon and titania. Each material has certain advantages. Silica has a high transparency for the activation of the titania by UV light, while activated carbon has a very high adsorption strength, which brings the contaminants in better contact with the titania. The creation of silica-carbon-titania particles is an attempt to utilize the positive aspects of all three materials. The silica gel-based particles are utilized as pellets and packed in a recirculating reactor design. An additional effort is made to incorporate magnets into the particles or coat magnetic media with photocatalysts for use in a magnetically agitated photocatalytic reactor (MAPR).

EVA occurs when astronauts wearing spacesuits travel outside their protective spacecraft to perform tasks in the space vacuum environment. US EVA started with pioneering feasibility tests during the Gemini Program. The Apollo Program required sending astronauts to the moon and performing EVA to explore the lunar surface. EVA supported scientific mission objectives of the Skylab program, but may be best remembered for repairing launch damage to the vehicle and thus saving the program. EVA capability on Shuttle was initially planned to be a kit that could be flown at will, and was primarily intended for coping with vehicle return emergencies. The Skylab emergency and the pivotal role of EVA in salvaging that program quickly promoted Shuttle EVA to an essential element for achieving mission objectives, including retrieving satellites and developing techniques to assemble and maintain the International Space Station (ISS). Now, EVA is supporting assembly of ISS. This paper highlights development of US EVA capability within the context of the overarching mission objectives of the US human space flight program. © 2002 International Astronautical Federation.

Gagarin on April 12, 1961, and then used on all subsequent Vostok-flights. The technical background for the design of these suits was the work on full pressure protective suits for military pilots and stratospheric flights in the 1930's through 50's. The Soviet-Russian space programme contains a large number of ,firsts', and one of the most well known is the first EVA by Leonov in 1965. This event is also the starting point for a long series of space suit development for Extravehicular Activities over the last 35 years. The next step to come was the transfer in void space of crew members between the two spacecraft Soyuz 4 and 5 in 1969. As has later become known this was an essential element in the planned Soviet lunar exploration programme, which in itself required a new space suit After the termination of the lunar programme in 1972, the space suit development concentrated on suits applicable to zero-gravity work around the manned space stations Salyut 6, Salyut 7 and MIR. These suits have become known as the ORLAN-family of suits, and an advanced version of this suit (ORLAN-M) will be used on the International Space Station together with the American EMU.

HSLAD also offers a potential option for treatment of biodegradable wastes on long-duration space missions and for permanent planetary bases. This process would produce 1.5 kg of methane, 4.1 kg of carbon dioxide and 1.9 kg of compost from 7.5 kg of biodegradable solid wastes generated daily from a crew of six.

For STS, crew clothing is stowed on the orbiter and returned to JSC for refurbishment. On Mir, clothing was supplied and then disposed of on Progress for incineration on re-entry. For ISS, the Russian laundry and 75% of the US laundry is placed on Progress for destructive re-entry. The rest of the US laundry is stowed in mesh bags and returned to earth in the Multi Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) or in the STS middeck. For previous missions, clothing was supplied and thrown away. Supplying clothing without washing dirty clothing will be costly for long-duration missions. An on-board laundry system may reduce overall mission costs, as shown in previous, less accurate, metric studies. Some design and development of flight hardware laundry systems has been completed, such as the SBIR Phase I and Phase II study performed by UMPQUA Research Company for JSC in 1993. However, while there has been significant development of ""commercial off the shelf"" products for terrestrial laundry applications, trade studies to evaluate the value of these approaches for use in space have been limited. Terrestrial laundry systems have made significant advances in reducing water, detergent, and power requirements over the past decade. It seems clear that non-traditional commercial technology has much to offer the human space program. It may be advantageous, as well as less costly, to build upon the expertise of industry to modify equipment for flight rather than engineering a laundry system for space applications from scratch. This study compared the equivalent system mass for commercial laundry systems to laundry supply for three long duration planetary missions and for ISS.

This paper looks at a range of waste-processing scenarios and calculated system ESM impacts related to these options. The lowest ESM approach is generally storage or dumping. However, other issues also need to be considered. Processing may be driven by requirements such as the need to recover commodities like water, prevent release of toxic gases into the spacecraft environment, planetary protection requirements, and interface loads.

Long-duration planetary missions will require Advanced Life Support (ALS) systems to provide methods for crop and food production, air and water recycling, and solid waste resource recovery. Among these principal life support functional areas, solid waste processing will need significant development. Because of this need, a solid waste processing and resource recovery (SWPRR) workshop was held in April 2000, to assess solid waste processing technologies. The purpose of the workshop was to gather data and provide input to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for a solid waste processing research and technology development (R&TD) strategy. This paper discusses the workshop assessment methodology and the results. The workshop was divided into four functional components of solid waste processing: 1) pre-processing, 2) physicochemical primary processing, 3) biological primary processing, and 4) post-treatment technologies. Prior to developing the technology assessment methodology, five potential Mars mission scenarios were assumed. These Mars scenarios ranged from transit vehicle to extended Martian base. Waste models detailing the quantity and quality of waste components expected for specific mission scenario elements were then established. Technology assessments were based on the waste model developed for each scenario. Technology assessments included identifying technology strengths and limitations in the context of the assumed NASA missions and highlighting possible approaches to overcome any limitations. Thirty-two candidate solid waste processing technologies were independently assessed using established parameters and criteria such as Equivalent System Mass (ESM), technology readiness levels (TRLs), reliability, use of expendables, and operational gravitational dependence performance needs.

In past studies, such a system has been defined in terms of technology types, hot and cold stream identification and stream energy content. The maximum steady-state potential for power and cooling savings within the system was computed via the Pinch Method. In this paper, the next step is taken toward achieving a pragmatic estimate of costs and savings associated with waste heat reuse in terms of equivalent system mass (ESM). In this paper, the assumption of steady-state flows are discarded, and a proposed schedule is developed for activities that are of interest in terms of waste heat reuse. The advanced life support system for the Mars Dual Lander Transit Vehicle is the system of interest.

Various groups have demonstrated that plants can support human life on the ground, and that plants can grow in space. One would suppose that plants are also able to support human life in space, though obviously it would be a good idea to demonstrate that ability before committing to a mission requiring bioregeneration. However, plant growth in space requires that we provide the necessary conditions for growth, and this might require not only providing water and fertilizer as we do in terrestrial agriculture, but also a controlled environment and lighting. This would make crops much more costly than we are accustomed to on Earth, where the majority of crops are grown outside and where natural sunlight is generally adequate. On the other hand, providing food, air, and water in space by any other means is also costly. The real question is whether and under what conditions it is cost effective to grow plants for life support in space. There are also intangible benefits in growing crops, and these need to be considered in designing a mission, though it is difficult to assess their importance. For simplicity, this paper uses a quantitative approach, and ignores, for now, intangible benefits. Cost effectiveness can be calculated for identified products and for a given mission where factors such as mission duration, equipment design, and mission equivalencies can be specified. Equivalent system mass (ESM) has been calculated for a number of plant products both for supply from Earth and for local production on Mars. A dimensionless number is then obtained by dividing the supply ESM by the local-production ESM. This ""goodness"" number will be greater than one when local production is cost-effective. Very different values of goodness are obtained according to the plant product for which the value is estimated. Thus, fresh tomatoes turn out to be worth more than dried tomatoes. This is probably realistic, as fresh tomatoes would cost more to ship, even if they could arrive in pristine condition (which, of course, is not the case). Furthermore, drying locally grown tomatoes would cost more in equipment, energy, and heat rejection, and probably in crew time, than the fresh product, so locally produced dried tomatoes would cost more per kg of usable product than fresh tomatoes. A correction can be applied to account for benefits of water and air regeneration, based on the reduced water and air systems that are needed when plants are grown. Thus, air regeneration would not be needed if the degree of food closure exceeds about 50%. However, gas storage, air circulation, and other functions would still be needed. With water, if it is accepted that plants can be used for producing potable water (and not everybody agrees with this due to concerns over pathogens and contaminants), functions such as storage and distribution would still be needed, but water closure would be reached at about 20% food closure. For simplicity, this correction has not been applied here Goodness is considered for a number of crops products and a number of assumptions, using a baseline of terrestrial growth-chamber productivity, Mars surface missions of variable durations, and established equivalencies.

Life support for the astronauts constitutes an extremely important part of the mission and will undoubtedly add significant mass, power, volume, cooling and crew time requirements to the mission. Equivalent system mass (ESM) is the sum of these five parameters on an equivalent mass basis and can be used to identify potential ways to reduce the overall cost of the mission. SIMA has documented several reference missions in enough detail to allow quantitative studies to identify optimum ALS architectures. The Mars Dual Lander Mission, under consideration by the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Exploration Office, is one of those missions. This mission requires three vehicles: a Mars Transit Vehicle that carries the crew between Earth and Mars orbit, a Mars Descent/Ascent Lander that carries the crew between Mars orbit and the Martian Surface, and a Surface Habitat Lander that houses the crew for a 600-day stay on the surface of Mars. The life support system includes six subsystems, Air, Biomass, Food, Thermal, Waste, and Water, as well as several important external interfaces. Although an optimum life support system configuration for this mission is not yet evident, one ""straw man"" architecture has been analyzed using the ESM method. This identifies which subsystems have the greatest ""cost"" for this mission and helps determine where technology investments will be the most effective at reducing this cost.

ESM is a cost-type metric based on allocated mass that is often used in life support systems. The previous paper suggested that the cost per hour of crew time should be equal to the ESM of the life support system, divided by the number of available crew work hours. We suggest here that the mass cost for additional crew time may be as large as the total mission mass or as small as the added mass of consumables, depending on how much more crew time is needed. If the increased mission work load requires flying additional crewmembers, the total mass and cost of the mission increases roughly proportionally to crew size. But if the needed work can be done merely by extending the mission duration, the required additional mass is only that of the food and supplies to be consumed during the time extension. The resulting upper and lower bounds on cost per hour of crew time are within an order of magnitude and can help resolve design decisions even when the total demand for crew time is unknown. However, the cost of crew time used in mission planning should not always be the actual cost to provide that time. The cost should be set at a level that ensures that the crew is neither under or overloaded. If little work is needed, we should set the price of crew time low or at zero to encourage more tasks. If the crew time demand is excessive, the cost should be set high to reduce the task requests. Imposing a low cost for low total demand and high for high will help guide the sum of crew time requests to converge to the desired workload.

The apparent electrical conversion efficiency of the HYSAL system with LEDs, however, exceeded that of the HYSAL system with XMH by five-fold.

Optimization of individual processors alone is not sufficient to minimize power needs; system studies must be performed in order to maximize power savings. It is important to develop system designs that are more efficiently integrated from an energy standpoint, so that the equivalent system mass of future life support systems can be reduced. In a procedure referred to as the 'pinch technique', hot and cold streams within the system are matched and their energy exchanged in order to lower the external cooling and heating requirements. This paper describes an investigation of power savings by application of the pinch technique to a closed life support system under steady-state conditions. The example system is a candidate design for the Johnson Space Center Advanced Life Support (ALS) Bioregenerative Planetary Life Support Systems Test Complex (BIO-Plex). The assumed design has partial food production using a biomass production chamber and treatment of 25% of solid wastes. First, steady state flowrates for the example system are determined. Next, the enthalpy loads associated with streams that require heating or cooling are calculated, and a heat cascade is performed to determine the minimum amounts of external heating and cooling required for the system. Then, a network representation of heat exchange equipment layout is developed. Next, savings for power and cooling are estimated. Lastly, recommendations are made on system designs that incorporate energy reuse, and plans for future applications of the pinch technique to dynamic systems are discussed.

We present here calculations for several sites within the brain from iron ions (z = 26) and from particles with charge, z, greater than or equal to 15. The same shielding configurations and sites in the brain used in an earlier paper for solar minimum are employed so that direct comparison of results between the two solar activity conditions can be made.

In the equipment room, typical results for the thalamus are that the probability of any particles with z greater than or equal to 15 and from 2.3 percent to 1.3 percent for iron ions. The extra shielding provided in the equipment room makes little difference in these numbers. We conclude that this decrease in hit frequency (less than a factor of two) does not provide a compelling reason to avoid solar minimum for a manned mission to Mars. This conclusion could be revised, however, if a very small number of hits is found to cause critical malfunction within the brain. © 2000 COSPAR.

Human presence on Mars will be characterized by the exceptionally long mission durations and the extremely limited chances of resupply from Earth, leading to a high degree of self-sufficiency. Habitability issues of relevance for such long-duration missions are manifold: natural and induced environment, health management, architecture, life management facilities. On-going ESA activities concern the development of habitability hardware (from equipment level to integrated habitat systems) and the establishment of human models and databases. Present-day research is mostly based on simulation in analogous environments, but eventually will require an increased fidelity of the models used. A dedicated, realistic and constraining testing environment will have to be created, to allow the simulation of virtually all aspects of an extra-terrestrial habitat (except micro-/reduced gravity). A Closed Ecological System, being a stable ecosystem, including the human being, that optimizes material recycling (essentially clean water and air, and food) from waste streams, will allow the simulation on Earth of both life support and habitability aspects in real conditions of confinement/recycling. In order to improve the global efficiency, stability and productivity of the system, both biological and physico-chemical technologies will have to be combined. The compatibility at a system level of all technologies, particularly the biological ones, will require long-duration testing/validation within the test facility. The selection of procedures and technologies for implementation into the Closed Ecological System will also be made to maximize the advantages induced by the potentials for adaptability and self-regulation of the Biotechnological Life Support Systems.

The focus of ethical attention has changed from the moral correctness of using animals for research/therapy to an increasingly appreciated danger of the establishment and spread of xenozoonoses in recipients, their contacts, and the general public. The United Kingdom has established an embargo on clinical trials and has set up a national regulatory authority to oversee and coordinate the development of research, establish guidelines, and decide on when trials can proceed. In the United States, on the other hand, the overall attitude is to 'proceed with caution,' and the Food and Drug Administration has approved a number of xenotransplant studies. The Public Health Service guidelines on reducing infection risk are still evolving and are likely to end up being more cautious than they are currently. There are a number of reasons for not using subhuman primates for xenotransplantation, including their closeness to humans, the likelihood of passing on infections, their depletability (gorillas, chimpanzees), their slow breeding, and the expense of breeding them under specified-pathogen free conditions. The pig, although domesticated and familiar, is too distant to evoke the same feelings we have for primates, has the correct-size organs, is probably less likely to pass on infections, breeds rapidly, and is not endangered; moreover, millions of them are eaten every year. Although drawing ethical conclusions is difficult, at this stage of knowledge and debate it seems acceptable to manipulate pigs genetically and to proceed to using their organs for xenotransplantation trials when infection control measures and the scientific base justify it. The question of informed consent is likely to be a vexing one. It might end up more of a binding legal contract than consent as we understand it now. Xenotransplantation is also unlikely to cost less than, or significantly alleviate the shortage of, cadaveric organs in the short term. The international dimension of the risk of infection is becoming obvious, but there has so far been no effort to convene an international forum to agree on universally acceptable guidelines.",,67,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Daar, A.

Active research has been ongoing since 1978 to develop and understand key components of this technology at universities and National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) centers around the United States. At the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, a large plant growth chamber has been producing higher plants since 1988. This chamber has proven highly successful at producing growing crops from germination to harvest, including wheat, soybean, potato and lettuce. This 113 cubic meter chamber is the largest such closed, controlled growth chamber in the world. In direct support of the chamber are laboratories which supply maintenance for all aspects of the chamber operations from producing nutrients tocontinuous monitoring and evaluation.1-2 As these CELSS systems become more developed and better documented, a next logical step is to better understand how these systems can be adapted to field and operation use. Such tests allow the CELSS system design to be directly adapted for remote operations by separating the extensive laboratory support from the bioengineering system. Engineers and scientists at the KSC Biological Research and Life Support Office have developed a functional plant module for testing in an extreme environment on the seafloor at Key Largo, Florida. The world's only fixed seafloor laboratory, the MarineLab, operated by the Marine Resources Development Foundation, has been selected as the site for a full test of this operational plant system. This project is called the Ocean CELSS Experimental Analog-NASA, or, the OCEAN Project. The OCEAN Project will test the plant bioengineering system for a 90-day crop of wheat (Yecora Rojo), three 28-day lettuce (Waldmann's Green) crops and dwarf tomato crops grown in succession. In addition to these plant and engineering system studies, the Principal Investigator will also test a 90-day diet prepared from foods that would be found in a CELSS type menu. (The plants grown will not be eaten.) This investigation will be conducted in association with the CELSS food science group at the Purdue University NSCORT. At the same time, five private industries testing CELSS technologies will participate in field testing their CELSS-related technology and research. And while the 90-day program is underway, an extensive educational program will be ongoing with eleven elementary schools, high schools and universities. Results from the 90 day project are expected to provide information on the capability to successfully transfer technology developed in the laboratory to a remote, extreme environment for operational use. A better understanding of the extent of crew time required to interface with such systems will be investigated along with detailed information on crew response to a CELSS-like diet. CELSS technology developed under various Small Business Innovative Research grants will also be evaluated on site as well as offering a very diverse opportunity for the nation's school children and a team of University of Florida students to remotely participate with the project. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Chamberland, Dennis"

These range from purely physical-chemical life support strategies to purely biological approaches. Within the context of biological based systems, a bioengineered system can be devised that would utilize the metabolic mechanisms of plants to control the rates of CO2 uptake and O2 evolution (phytosynthesis) and water production (transpiration). Such a mechanism of external engineering control has become known as ""throttling"". Research conducted at the John F. Kennedy Space Center's Controlled Ecological Life Support System Breadboard Project has demonstrated the potential of throttling these fluxes by changing environmental parameters affecting the plant processes. Among the more effective environmental throttles are: light and CO2 concentration for controlling the rate of photosynthesis and humidity and CO2 concentration for controlling transpiration.

The Initiative has attracted the interest of individuals and organizations in Canada because of its tremendous potential and challenge. In 1990, the Canadian Space Agency convened an internal Working Group with the intent of examining potential Canadian involvement in the SEI and related exploration. The Working Group's initial appraisal led to identification of the following areas of possible interest: science; space communications and spacecraft subsystems; planetology, remote sensing & resources; robotics; life sciences; biotechnology for life support; and energy. The Working Group explored each of the areas in more depth via consultant contracts and advice from Science Working Groups. The activity included surveys of individuals and agencies in Canada to establish the level of capability and interest in the various areas.

However, it is a biocompatible planet. Its unalterable astrophysical parameters would allow the maintenance of a much thicker, warmer carbon dioxide atmosphere than that which currently exists. Though very cold (averaging about -60°C), highly oxidizing and desiccated, Mars may possess substantial quantities of the materials needed to support life - in particular, water and carbon dioxide. A general scenario for implanting life on Mars would include three main phases: (1) robotic and human exploration to determine whether sufficiently large and accessible volatile inventories are available; (2) planetary engineering designed to warm the planet, release liquid water and produce a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere; and (3) if no indigenous Martian organisms emerge as liquid water becomes available, a program of biological engineering designed to construct and implant pioneering microbial communities able to proliferate in the newly clement, though still anaerobic, Martian environment. The process of establishing an ecosystem, or biosphere, on a lifeless planet is best termed 'ecopoiesis.' This new word, derived from Greek, means 'the making of an abode for life.' It is by no means clear whether ecopoiesis on Mars is scientifically possible or technologically achievable. Thus we urge that it be one of the objectives of space research during the next century to assess the feasibility of ecopoiesis on Mars. © 1991.",,36,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"Haynes, Robert H.;McKay, Christopher P."

Located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of southern Victoria Land (160° and 164° E longitude and 76°30′ and 78°30′ S latitude), research outposts are inhabited by teams of 4-6 scientists. We propose that the design of these outposts be expanded to enable meaningful tests of many of the systems that will be needed for the successful conduct of exploration activities on Mars. Although there are some important differences between the environment in the Antarctic dry valleys and on Mars, the many similarities and particularly the field science activities, make the dry valleys a useful terrestrial analog to conditions on Mars. Three areas have been identified for testing at a small science outpost in the dry valleys: 1) studying human factors and physiology in an isolated environment; 2) testing emerging technologies (e.g., innovative power management systems, advanced life support facilities including partial bioregenerative life support systems for water recycling and food growth, telerobotics, etc.); and 3) conducting basic scientific research that will enhance our understanding of Mars while contributing to the planning for human exploration.

Appropriately configured elements of the FTS will also be employed for robotic manipulation in remote satellite servicing applications and possibly the Lunar/Mars Program. In mid-1989, the FTS entered the flight system design and implementation phase (Phase C D) of development with the signing of the FTS prime contract with Martin Marietta Astronautics Group in Denver, Colorado. The basic FTS design is now established and can be reported on in some detail. This paper will describe the FTS flight system design and the rationale for the specific design approaches and component selections. The current state of space technology and the general nature of the FTS task dictate that the FTS be designed with sophisticated teleoperation capabilities for its initial primary operating mode. However, there are technologies, such as advanced computer vision and autonomous planning techniques currently in research and advanced development phases which would greatly enhance the FTS capabilities to perform autonomously in less structured work environments. Therefore, a specific requirement on the initial FTS design is that it has the capability to evolve as new technology becomes available. This paper will describe the FTS design approach for evolution to more autonomous capabilities. Some specific task applications of the FTS and partial automation approaches of these tasks will also be discussed in this paper. © 1991.",,3,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"McCain, Harry G.;Andary, James F.;Hewitt, Dennis R.;Haley, Dennis C."

This colonization of extraterrestrial bodies will most likely begin with the establishment of small research outposts on the Moon and/or Mars. In all probability these facilities, designed primarily for conducting exploration and basic science, will have international participation in their crews, logistical support and funding. High fidelity Earth-based simulations of planetary exploration could help prepare for these expensive and complex operations. Antarctica provides one possible venue for such a simulation. The hostile and remote dry valleys of southern Victoria Land offer a valid analog to the Martian environment but are sufficiently accessible to allow routine logistical support and to assure the relative safety of their inhabitants. An Antarctic research outpost designed as a planetary exploration simulation facility would have great potential as a testbed and training site for the operation of future Mars bases and represents a near-term, relatively low-cost alternative to other precursor activities. Antarctica already enjoys an international dimension, an aspect that is more than symbolically appropriate to an international endeavor of unprecedented scientific and social significance--planetary exploration by humans. Potential uses of such a facility include: 1) studying human factors in an isolated environment (including long-term interactions among an international crew); 2) testing emerging technologies (e.g., advanced life support facilities such as a partial bioregenerative life support system, advanced analytical and sample acquisition instrumentation and equipment, etc.); and 3) conducting basic scientific research similar to the research that will be conducted on Mars, while contributing to the planning for human exploration.

The effects of surface grades, surface characteristics, backpack weights, and cart weights on metabolic cost for various locomotive rates were determined. The range of surface characteristics investigated had only a small effect on the metabolic costs of locomotion. Pulling a cart weighing 165 lb, earth weight, on a level surface did not increase the energy cost of locomotion over that obtained without the cart.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,SBE,,,"CAMACHO A, ;ROBERTSON W, ;WALTHER A, "

Several factors which limit widespread use of these reading media among the blind are currently being studied by research workers. Other efforts are being directed towards the development of tape-recorded ""talking book"" libraries and to the design of personal devices which convert print directly into speech or into sounds that the blind person can ""read"" and understand.
